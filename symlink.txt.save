SYNOPSIS
       ln [OPTION]... [-T] TARGET LINK_NAME
       ln [OPTION]... TARGET
       ln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY
       ln [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY TARGET...

DESCRIPTION
In  the  1st  form,  create  a  link  to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.  	
In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET  in  the current directory.  
In the 3rd and 4th forms, create links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.  

Create hard links by default, symbolic  links  with  --symbolic.  
By default, each destination(name of new link) should not already exist.   

When  creating
       hard  links, each TARGET must exist.  Symbolic links can hold
       arbitrary text; if later resolved, a relative link is  inter‚Äê
       preted in relation to its parent directory.

MAKING A SYMBOLIC LINK FOR DROPBOX TO HOME DIRECTORY
1. Make a symlink from WSL `home` directory

ln --symbolic "/mnt/c/Users/catte/Dropbox/Tech Learning/GitHub/Boot.dev/" "Boot.dev"2. If I want to 
ide this?
chflags -h hidden
