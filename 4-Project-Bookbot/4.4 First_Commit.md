# FIRST COMMIT

Update README.md with:

```bash
BookBot is my first project!
```

# VIEW YOUR DIFF

A "diff" is a visual aid that shows you the differences between two files. Now that you've saved a change, you should see a blue notification pill on the "source control" icon on the left of your VS Code window.

## ![alt text](img/diff.JPG)

Click on it, and under "changes" take a look at your `README.md` file - you should see the diff view.

I like to use UI tooling (like this diff view) for visualizing changes, but I recommend using the command line for _applying_ changes to Git. If your change looks good to you, let's push it up to GitHub.

# STAGE THE CHANGE

The "`.`" tells git to stage all the changes in the directory and all subdirectories.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/Github/bookbot$ git add .
```

# COMMIT THE CHANGE

The commit message will be stored in Git alongside the change. In the future, if you wanted to revert this change, or jump back in time to the code at this state, you would use the commit message to find the right change. As such, try to use a descriptive commit message!

Run this command:

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/Github/bookbot$ git commit -m "update readme with a description"
[main 4d6657d] update readme with a description
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

# PUSH TO GITHUB

Now that your change has been committed locally, you should notice that your source control tab on the left no longer has a blue notification - all your changes are committed! However, the commit hasn't been pushed up to GitHub yet for safekeeping. Run this command:

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/Github/bookbot$ git push origin main

```

- `git push` pushes local changes to a remote location - like GitHub.
- `origin` is a name that refers to your GitHub repo for this project; it was configured automatically when you cloned your repo.
- `main` is the name of GitHub's default branch for your repo.
