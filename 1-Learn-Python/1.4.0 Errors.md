## Reminder about Error Handling Syntax

You use `try-except` patterns

```python
try:
    #main code
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

## _What is happening under the hood?_

- The `try` block is executed until an exception is raised or it completes, whichever happens first. In this case, a "divide by zero" error is raised because division by zero is impossible.
- The `except` block is only executed if an exception is raised in the `try` block.
- It then exposes the exception as data (`e` in our case) so that the program can handle the exception gracefully without crashing.

## Raising your own Error Syntax

```python
raise Exception("something bad happened")

# Example
def purchase(price, money_available):

    if money_available - price >= 0:
        return money_available - price
    else:
        raise Exception("not enough money")
        # Notice you dont need a try-except block. That is handling.
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment 1: PURCHASING Pt. 1</strong></span>

You've been asked to work on the checkout flow of a popular e-commerce site.

## ASSIGNMENT

Complete the `purchase` function. If the customer doesn't have enough money raise an exception with the text _"not enough money"_. _Don't_ handle the exception.

Otherwise, return the amount of money the customer has leftover after completing the purchase.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def purchase(price, money_available):

    if money_available - price >= 0:
        return money_available - price
    else:
        raise Exception("not enough money")

```

## Output

```python
---------------------------------
Inputs:
 * price: 10.00
 * money_available: 20.00
Expected: 10.00
  Actual: 10.00

Pass

---------------------------------
Inputs:
 * price: 30.00
 * money_available: 20.00
Expected Exception: not enough money
  Actual Exception: not enough money

Pass

============= PASS ==============
2 passed, 0 failed
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment 2: PURCHASING Pt. 2</strong></span>

Now we need to use our `purchase` function to process an entire list of purchase orders.

## Assignment

Complete the `make_purchases` function. It takes a list of purchase orders. Each order is a dictionary. Look through the `main()` function to see the shape of this data.

- First, create an empty list of `leftovers`. <input type="checkbox" unchecked/>
- Then, loop over the list of purchase orders. <input type="checkbox" unchecked/>
- For each order, try to process the order with the `purchase` function. If an exception is raised, print this string, `Purchase exception: ERROR`, where `ERROR` is the exception's text. <input type="checkbox" unchecked/>
- If there is _not_ an error, then the purchase was successful. Append the remaining money to the `leftovers` list. If there is an error, don't add anything to the `leftovers`. <input type="checkbox" unchecked/>
- Be sure to loop over the entire list of purchase orders. <input type="checkbox" unchecked/>
- At the end of the loop, return the leftovers list. <input type="checkbox" unchecked/>

_Keep the same order of purchases, but with the unsuccessful purchases removed._

```python
def make_purchases(purchase_orders):
    leftovers = []
    # Input: List of purchase orders where each order is a dictionary

    print("Entering list...")
    for dictionary in purchase_orders:
        print("I am on the next purchase order")
        print("Entering dictionary...")
        for item in dictionary:
            #print(f"    {item} costs {dictionary[item]}")



# Don't edit below this line


def main():
    print("Making purchases...")
    leftovers = make_purchases(
        [
            {"price": 10.00, "money_available": 125.00},
            {"price": 5.00, "money_available": 2.00},
            {"price": 20.01, "money_available": 5.20},
            {"price": 1.04, "money_available": 254.00},
            {"price": 40.20, "money_available": 6.00},
            {"price": 16.00, "money_available": 235.01},
            {"price": 10.70, "money_available": 10.70},
            {"price": 12.00, "money_available": 2.30},
        ]
    )
    print("Purchases complete!")
    print("Leftover amounts for successful purchases:")
    for leftover in leftovers:
        print(f" * {leftover:.2f}")


def purchase(price, money_available):
    if money_available < price:
        raise Exception(f"{money_available:.2f} is not enough for {price:.2f}")
    return money_available - price


main()
```

## Output

```python
