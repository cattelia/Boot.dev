# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment 1: DICTIONARIES</strong></span>

<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries">Dictionaries</a> in Python are used to store data values in `key` -> `value` pairs. Dictionaries are a great way to store groups of information.

```python
# use curly braces
# add key-value pairs
car = {
  "brand": "Tesla",
  "model": "3",
  "year": 2019
}
```

## ASSIGNMENT

Complete the get_character_record function. It takes a character's name, server, level, and rank as individual inputs, and returns a dictionary with the following keys:

- `name`
- `server`
- `level`
- `rank`
- `id`

Each key should map to its corresponding input, except the id key. The id key maps to the `name` and the `server` inputs concatenated with a `#` in the middle for uniqueness. We can't have two bloodwarrior123's on the same server!

For example, given:

- name = bloodwarrior123
- server = server1

Then the `id` field should be set to `bloodwarrior123#server1`. I recommend using an `f-string` to create the `id` field.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def get_character_record(name, server, level, rank):
    character = {
        "name" : name,
        "server" : server,
        "level" : level,
        "rank": rank,
        "id" : f"{name}#{server}"
    }

    return character
```

## Output

```python
---------------------------------
Test Case #1

Expected: name: bloodwarrior123
Actual:   name: bloodwarrior123

Expected: server: server1
Actual:   server: server1

Expected: level: 5

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment 2: DUPLICATE KEYS</strong></span>

Because dictionaries rely on unique keys, you can't have two of the same key in the same dictionary. If you try to use the same key twice, the first value will simply be overwritten.

## ASSIGNMENT

Another developer on our team has introduced a bug by specifying duplicate keys in the dictionary! Fix the bug.

The `get_character_record function` takes a character's `name`, `server`, `level`, and `rank`. It should return a dictionary with the following fields:

- name
- server
- level
- rank
- id

Where the `id` is the `name` and the `server` concatenated together with a `#` in the middle for uniqueness. We can't have two `bloodwarrior123`'s on the same server!

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def get_character_record(name, server, level, rank):
    return {
        "name": name,
        "server": server,
        "level": level,
        #"level": 1,
        "rank": rank,
        #"rank": 2,
        "id": f"{name}#{server}",
    }
```

## Output

```python
---------------------------------
Inputs: bloodwarrior123, server1, 5, 1
Expecting: {'name': 'bloodwarrior123', 'server': 'server1', 'level': 5, 'rank': 1, 'id': 'bloodwarrior123#server1'}
Actual: {'name': 'bloodwarrior123', 'server': 'server1', 'level': 5, 'rank': 1, 'id': 'bloodwarrior123#server1'}

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment 3: COUNTING PRACTICE</strong></span>

## CHECKING FOR EXISTENCE

If you're unsure whether or not a key exists in a dictionary, use the `in` keyword.

```python
cars = {
    'ford': 'f150',
    'tesla': '3'
}

print('ford' in cars)
# Prints: True

print('gmc' in cars)
# Prints: False
```

## ASSIGNMENT

We need to be able to report to our players how many enemies are in their immediate vicinity - but they want the count of each enemy by its kind. Complete the `count_enemies` function. It takes a list of enemy names as input. It should return a dictionary where the keys are all the enemy names from the list, and the values are the counts of how many times each enemy appeared in the list.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def count_enemies(enemy_names):
    """
    In -> List of enemy names
    Out -> Dict {name:time they showed in list}
    """

    enemy_dict = {}

    for enemy in enemy_names:
        if enemy not in enemy_dict:
            enemy_dict[enemy] = 1
        else:
            enemy_dict[enemy] += 1

    #print(enemy_dict)
    return enemy_dict
```

## Output

```python
---------------------------------

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment 4: <br>ITERATING OVER A DICTIONARY IN PYTHON</strong></span>

```python
fruit_sizes = {
  "apple": "small",
  "banana": "large",
  "grape": "tiny"
}

for name in fruit_sizes:
  size = fruit_sizes[name]
  print(f"name: {name}, size: {size}")

# name: apple, size: small
# name: banana, size: large
# name: grape, size: tiny
```

## ASSIGNMENT

We need to display on our player's screens what the most common enemy in a given area of the game map is.

Complete the `get_most_common_enemy` function by iterating over all enemies in the dictionary and returning only the name of the enemy with the highest count. If there are no enemies, return `None`.

`enemies_dict` is a dictionary of `name` -> `count`.

### TIP: NEGATIVE INFINITY

// When you're trying to find a "max" value, it helps to keep track of the "max so far" in a variable and to start that variable at the lowest possible number, negative infinity.

```python
max_so_far = float("-inf")
```

You'll also want to keep track of the enemy name associated with the maximum count. I would set the default for that variable to `None`.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def get_most_common_enemy(enemies_dict):
    if len(enemies_dict) == 0:
       return None
    #print(max(enemies_dict.values()))
    # A ton of help from: https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-dict-value-max-min/
    return max(enemies_dict, key=enemies_dict.get)

    # The long way, I think the way they wanted me todo it.
    max_right_now = float("-inf")
    current_enemy = None

    for enemy in enemies_dict:
        #print(enemies_dict[enemy])
        if enemies_dict[enemy] > max_right_now:
            max_right_now = enemies_dict[enemy]
            current_enemy = enemy

    return current_enemy
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment 5: CHECK GRADE</strong></span>

A local college is having trouble with its student administration program. They have asked you to help them get a student's grade from their `English_1010` class.

Here's the structure of a `student` dictionary:

```python
{
    "type": {
        "student": {
            "name": "Allan",
            "courses": {
                "math_1050": {
                    "current_grade": "B",
                },
                "English_1010": {
                    "current_grade": "A-",
                },
            },
        }
    }
}
```

## CHALLENGE

Complete the `get_english_grade` function. It accepts a `student` <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesting_%28computing%29">nested</a> dictionary and returns the student's grade in English 1010. Chain the keys.

_Hint: If the value retrieved from a dictionary is itself a dictionary, how would you access its values?_

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def get_english_grade(student_dict):
    #classes = student_dict["type"]["student"]
    #grade = classes["courses"]["English_1010"]["current_grade"]
    return student_dict["type"]["student"]["courses"]["English_1010"]["current_grade"]
```

## Output

```python
---------------------------------
Inputs:
 * Student Dictionary: {'type': {'student': {'name': 'Allan', 'courses': {'math_1050': {'current_grade': 'C'}, 'English_1010': {'current_grade': 'A-'}}}}}

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment 6: TOTAL SCORE</strong></span>

A website that tracks basketball scores and stats is having trouble with its data. The first-half score and second-half score are stored in separate dictionaries, making it difficult for them to parse the overall score. They have asked you to help them write a program that merges the two dictionaries and another function that calculates the total score.

## CHALLENGE

Complete the `merge` and `total_score` functions.

The `merge` function accepts two score dictionaries as input and returns a single merged dictionary that contains all of the keys and values from the input dictionaries.

The `total_score` function should take a single score dictionary as input and return the total score calculated from the values of that dictionary. Take a look at the test suite near the top of the file for the names of keys to expect. If no points were scored, the function should return `0`.

Don't forget: you can always add `print()` statements to your code so that you can debug your code before submitting! Print out values of variables to see what's going on, and question your assumptions about what you think is happening.

## EXAMPLE OF DEBUGGING WITH PRINT STATEMENTS

```python
def `total_score`(score_dict):
  print(f"score_dict: {score_dict}")
  for key in score_dict:
    print(f"key: {key}")
```

You would then run your code and manually inspect the output to see what's going on. You can always remove the print statements when you're done debugging if you want.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def merge(dict1, dict2):
    # Auxilary support: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-merging-two-dictionaries/
    new_dict = dict1 | dict2
    return new_dict


def total_score(score_dict):
    final_score = 0
    for i in score_dict:
        final_score += score_dict[i]
    return final_score
```

## <span style="color:#0F77A5">Boot.dev Solution</span>

```python
# Including this here because I believe the point was to learn key:value pairs and not some cool Python method trick.
def merge(dict1, dict2):
    merged_dict = {}
    for k in dict1:
        merged_dict[k] = dict1[k]
    for k in dict2:
        merged_dict[k] = dict2[k]
    return merged_dict


def total_score(score_dict):
    total = 0
    for k in score_dict:
        total += score_dict[k]
    return total
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment 6: GROCERY SHOPPING</strong></span>

Emma has been overspending recently and wants you to write a script that will help her manage her finances when she's grocery shopping.

## CHALLENGE

Complete the `calculate_total` function.

## INPUTS

- `items_purchased`: A list of the names of items purchased on this shopping trip. This is a list of strings.
- `grocery_list`: A list of the names of items Emma wanted to purchase. This is also a list of strings.

## OUTPUTS

The function should return 3 values in this order:

- `unpurchased_items`: A list of all the item names in `grocery_list` that weren't found in `items_purchased` in order.
- `receipt`: A dictionary containing all the items Emma purchased, even stuff not on her list. The keys are the item names and the values are their respective prices from the item_prices dictionary.
- `total`: The total cost of all the items that were purchased.
  Return each value _separately_, not in a list. For example:

```python
return item1, item2, item3
```

_Note: The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists">.remove()</a> list method may be helpful._
