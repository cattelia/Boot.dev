# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>PRIME & MODULOS</strong></span>

A math student is working on a project and needs an easy way to determine whether or not a number is prime. She asked you to write a program to help her.

## CHALLENGE

Write a function that takes a single number as input and returns `True` if it is a prime number or `False` if it is not.

## WHAT IS A PRIME NUMBER?

A prime number is a positive integer, greater than 1, that is only divisible by itself and 1. For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all prime numbers, but 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not.

## TIP

// _0 and 1 are not prime numbers! And don't forget to catch all negative numbers!_

// _We'll talk more about it next chapter, but you can use the modulo operator `%` to find a remainder. For example, `7 % 2` would be `1`, because 2 can be multiplied evenly into 7 at most 3 times._

```python
remainder = 8 % 3
# remainder = 2
```

```python
remainder = 9 % 3
# remainder = 0
```

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

_I'm really proud of it. :]_

```python
def is_prime(number):
    # Positive number and is Greater than 1
    if number <= 1:
        return False
    # Make a list of the remainder calculated from 1 - 9 divisors
    multiplier_count = [(number % i) for i in range(1, number + 1)]

    # If the list Comprehensions has more than 2 "0's" it means that
    #    the number is not Prime

    return False if multiplier_count.count(0) > 2 else True
```

## Output

```python
---------------------------------
Input number: 7
Expecting: True
[0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0]
Actual: True
Pass

---------------------------------
Input number: -7
Expecting: False
Actual: False
Pass

---------------------------------
Input number: 9
Expecting: False
[0, 1, 0, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
Actual: False
Pass

---------------------------------
Input number: 23
Expecting: True
[0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 2, 7, 5, 3, 1, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
Actual: True
Pass

============= PASS ==============
4 passed, 0 failed
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Challenge: Meditation</strong></span>

## CHALLENGE

Complete the `meditate` function using a while loop. It takes mana, `max_mana`, `energy` and `energy_potions` integers.

- While meditating, a character converts `1` `energy` into up to `3` `mana` for each iteration of the loop.
- `mana` cannot exceed the `max_mana`.
- If they have any `energy_potions` when they run out of `energy`, they will use `1` `energy potion` to gain `50` `energy` and continue meditating.
- A character will stop meditating if either:
  - Their `mana` reaches the `max_mana`, or
  - They run out of `energy` and `energy_potions`.
- `return` the `mana` and remaining `energy` and `energy_potions` when the character stops meditating.

### TIP

// _Don't forget! A character cannot have more `mana` than their `max_mana` threshold. Be sure to handle cases where meditate raises their mana above their max._

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def meditate(mana, max_mana, energy, energy_potions):

    while mana <= max_mana:
        # Base case.
        if mana + 1 > max_mana or energy == 0 and energy_potions == 0:
            return mana, energy, energy_potions


        if energy == 0 and energy_potions > 0:
            #print("Using 1 potion")
            energy_potions -= 1
            energy += 50


        if mana == 0:
            #print("Mana is 0, adding 3 mana.")
            energy -= 1
            mana += 3
            #print(f"Mana: {mana}, Max Mana: {max_mana}, Energy: {energy}")

        elif mana + 3 <= max_mana:
            energy -= 1
            mana += 3

        else:
            energy -= 1
            mana += ((max_mana - mana) % 3)
            #print(f"Mana: {mana}, Max Mana: {max_mana}, Energy: {energy}")
```

# OUTPUT

```python
---------------------------------
Inputs:
 *           mana: 0
 *       max_mana: 10
 *         energy: 3
 * energy_potions: 0
Expecting: mana 9, energy 0, energy potions 0
Mana is 0, adding 3 mana.
Mana: 3, Max Mana: 10, Energy: 2
   Actual: mana 9, energy 0, energy potions 0
Pass

 *       max_mana: 12
 *         energy: 0
 * energy_potions: 1

Using 1 potion
Mana is 0, adding 3 mana.
Mana: 3, Max Mana: 12, Energy: 49
   Actual: mana 12, energy 46, energy potions 0
Pass
---------------------------------
Inputs:
 *           mana: 1
 *       max_mana: 100
 *         energy: 33

   Actual: mana 100, energy 0, energy potions 2
Pass
============= PASS ==============
3 passed, 0 failed
