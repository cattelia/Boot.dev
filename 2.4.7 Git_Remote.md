# GIT REMOTE

Often our frenemies (read: coworkers) make code changes that we need to begrudgingly accept into our pristine bug-free repos. _/s_

This is where the "distributed" in "distributed version control system" comes from. We can have "remotes", which are just external repos with _mostly_ the same Git history as our local repo.

When it comes to Git (the CLI tool), there really isn't a "central" repo. GitHub is just someone else's repo. Only by convention and convenience have we, as developers, started to use GitHub as a "source of truth" for our code.

### Starting out

Let's create a second repo called "webflyx-local" as a sibling directory to our original "webflyx" repo.

1. Use `cd` to get back to `root`.
2. Use `mkdir` to create a new directory which we will call, "webflyx-local" and `cd` into it.
3. Use `git init` to create a new branch inside of "webflyx-local".

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ cd ~
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ mkdir webflyx-local
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ ls
Downloads  go       webflyx-local  worldbanc.zip
github     webflyx  worldbanc
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ cd webflyx-local/
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local$ git init
# Initialized empty Git repository in /home/cattelia/webflyx-local/.git/
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local$ ls -a
.  ..  .git

# Send test packages
All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

# ADDING A REMOTE

In git, another repo is called a "remote." The standard convention is that when you're treating the remote as the "authoritative source of truth" (such as GitHub) you would name it the "origin".

By "authoritative source of truth" we mean that it's the one you and your team treat as the "true" repo. It's the one that contains the most up-to-date version of the accepted code.

## Command Syntax

```bash
git remote add <name> <uri>
```

### Try it myself

Inside our new repo, add `webflyx` and give it the name `origin`. The `uri` should just be a relative path to the `webflyx` directory, in our case, `../webflyx`.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local$ git remote add origin ../webflyx

# Let's find where this information went starting with .git
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local$ cd .git/
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local/.git$ ls
HEAD  branches  config  description  hooks  info  objects  refs

# Notice that we will find the information under `remote`
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local/.git$ cat config
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[remote "origin"]
        url = ../webflyx
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

# Send test packages
All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

# FETCH

Adding a remote to our Git repo does _not_ mean that we automagically have all the contents of the remote. First, we need to <a herf="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch">fetch</a> the contents. Using command:

```bash
git fetch
```

This downloads copies of all the contents of the `.git/objects` directory (and other book-keeping information) from the remote repository into your current one.

### Try it myself

```bash
# First, let's see what is in `.git/objects`
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local$ find .git/objects/
.git/objects/
.git/objects/info
.git/objects/pack
# It should be eerily empty with only 3 entries because we haven't fetched anything yet.

# Now bring `webflyx` repo info into `webflyx-local` with `fetch`
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local$ git fetch
remote: Enumerating objects: 30, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (30/30), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (28/28), done.
remote: Total 30 (delta 9), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (30/30), 2.91 KiB | 40.00 KiB/s, done.
From ../webflyx
 * [new branch]      main          -> origin/main
 * [new branch]      update_dune   -> origin/update_dune
 * [new branch]      update_titles -> origin/update_titles

 # Now, let's see what is in `.git/objects` now
 cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local$ find .git/objects/
.git/objects/
...
.git/objects/3a
.git/objects/3a/e514c005db0f1e19b0e4be54ea116e6a6950ef
.git/objects/3a/f42c36ab51c7e56fc46cea23ecb351b9ee9d07
...
.git/objects/info
.git/objects/pack

# Send test packages
All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

# NOT FETCHED

Just because we fetched all of the metadata from the remote `webflyx` repo doesn't mean we have all of the files. To demonstrate this, run `git log` inside the `webflyx-local` repo. You should see that you don't have any commits.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local$ git log
fatal: your current branch 'main' does not have any commits yet
```

# LOG REMOTE

The `git log` command isn't only useful for your local repo. You can log the commits of a remote repo as well!

```bash
git log remote/branch
```

For example, if you wanted to see the commits of a branch named `primeagen` from a remote named `origin` you would run:

```bash
git log origin/primeagen
```

### Try it myself

1. Run `git log` on the remote `webflyx` repo's `update_dune` branching using `--oneline` flag. Run it within `webflyx-local`. _I should see commits "A" through "I"_

```bash
# Confirm I am in `webflyx-local`
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local$ pwd
/home/cattelia/webflyx-local
# Search for the commit logs inside of branch: update_dune in origin
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local$ git log origin/update_dune --oneline
1684334 (origin/update_dune) I: update dune.md
46eff0e H: update dune.md
ef237e8 (origin/update_titles, origin/main) G: add titles
39b9349 F: Merge branch 'add_classics'
aa9c7dd E: update contents.md
2df649c D: add classics.csv
f3a8dab C: add quotes
f576ca1 B: add titles
2eba3e1 A: add contents.md

# Send test packages
All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

# MERGE [REMOTES]

Just as we merged branches within a single local repo, we can also merge branches between local and remote repos.

```bash
git merge remote/branch
```

For example, if you wanted to merge the `primeagen` branch of the remote `origin` into your local `main` branch, you would run this inside the local repo while on the `main` branch:

```bash
git merge origin/primeagen
```

### Try it myself

```bash
# Merge the remote `origin/main` into the local repo's `main` branch
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local$ git merge origin/main
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx-local$ git log --oneline
ef237e8 (HEAD -> main, origin/update_titles, origin/main) G: add titles
39b9349 F: Merge branch 'add_classics'
aa9c7dd E: update contents.md
2df649c D: add classics.csv
f3a8dab C: add quotes
f576ca1 B: add titles
2eba3e1 A: add contents.md

# Send test packages
All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

This should have gotten a nice clean <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_fast_forward_merge">fast-forward</a> merge when we did this since there was nothing in here.
