## Reminder about Error Handling Syntax

You use `try-except` patterns

```python
try:
    #main code
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

## _What is happening under the hood?_

- The `try` block is executed until an exception is raised or it completes, whichever happens first. In this case, a "divide by zero" error is raised because division by zero is impossible.
- The `except` block is only executed if an exception is raised in the `try` block.
- It then exposes the exception as data (`e` in our case) so that the program can handle the exception gracefully without crashing.

## Raising your own Error Syntax

```python
raise Exception("something bad happened")
```

You've been asked to work on the checkout flow of a popular e-commerce site.

## ASSIGNMENT

Complete the `purchase` function. If the customer doesn't have enough money raise an exception with the text _"not enough money"_. _Don't_ handle the exception.

Otherwise, return the amount of money the customer has leftover after completing the purchase.

```python
def purchase(price, money_available):
```
