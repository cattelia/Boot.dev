# WHAT IS A FILESYSTEM?

All the data stored on your computer is organized into files and directories. Files and directories are organized into a tree-like structure called a filesystem.

![alt text](image.png)

- Directories (same as "folders" on Windows) are just containers that hold files and other directories.
- Files are just a dump of raw binary data: 1's and 0's. The bytes in a file can represent anything: text, images, videos, etc.

The filesystem tree starts with a single directory called the root directory. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_directory">root directory</a> contains files and directories, which can contain more files and directories, and so on.

When you open your terminal, your working directory (the one you're "in") is going to be... somewhere. Most commonly it is your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory">"home" directory</a>.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: NAVIGATING FILE SYSTEMS</strong></span>

You've just remotely logged onto a suspicious employee's machine at WorldBanc. First, you need to determine where on their filesystem you are...

Run the "print working directory" command to see the filepath of your current working directory:

```bash
pwd
```

- What is the first character of the path to your working directory?: `/`

# FILEPATHS

The output of your `pwd` command is a _filepath_. A filepath is a string that describes the location of a file or directory on your computer. Yours should look something like this:

```bash
/Users/wagslane
```

The text might be different, but the structure should be the same. Let's break it down:

- The first slash (`/`) represents the root directory. It's the tippy-top of the filesystem tree.
- The next part (`Users`) is the name of a directory inside the root directory.
- Finally, the last part (`wagslane`) is the name of a directory inside the `Users` directory.

So this path represents a directory 2 levels down from the root directory:

```bash
root
  └── Users
       └── wagslane
```

### Download the repo and make directory using following:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/bootdotdev/worldbanc/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -o worldbanc.zip
unzip worldbanc.zip
rm worldbanc.zip
mv worldbanc-main worldbanc
sudo chown -R $(whoami) worldbanc
sudo chmod -R 755 worldbanc
```

- When entering `ls`, what does your screen say?

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls
README.md  go.mod  private  public
```

# PARENT DIRECTORIES

We talked about how you can "change directory" to move into a directory. But how do you move back out of a directory? The answer is two dots: `..`

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu: cd ..
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls
README.md  go.mod  private  public
```

# ABSOLUTE vs RELATIVE FILE PATHS

**Absolute file path** to `worldbanc/` from `mnt`

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/catte/Dropbox/Tech Learning/GitHub/Boot.dev/worldbanc/
```

**Relative file path** to `worldbanc/` from `Boot.dev/`

```bash
cd worldbanc/
```

# MORE OR LESS

The `more` and `less` commands let you view the contents of a file one page (or line) at a time.

```bash
less 2023.csv
```

What I get in return:

```bash
amount,from_user_id,to_user_id,from_name,to_name,created_at
80.16,18,14,Steve,Oscar,2023-07-05 08:43:55

# DIRECTORIES

A directory is just a location in a filesystem that can contain files and other directories. On some systems, they are called "folders".

# THE MKDIR COMMAND

The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=m-mkdir-command">"make directory"</a> command creates a new directory inside the current directory.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USING `MKDIR`</strong></span>

We see that `../credit_cards/` has a file that does not belong there. Make a new directory called `investments`.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls
accounts  cds  credit_cards  loans
cattelia@Amaterasu: mkdir investments
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls
accounts  cds  credit_cards  investments  loans
```

# MOVE

The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=files-moving-renaming-mv-command">move command</a> moves a file or directory from one location to another.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USING `MV`</strong></span>

Now that we have made a new directory, we need to move the documentation out of `credit cards` and into `investments`.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu: cd worldbanc/public/products/credit_cards/
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls -l

-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 37 Apr 15 14:11 "creditplus.txt"
-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 37 Apr 15 14:11 "economypoints.txt"
-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 37 Apr 15 14:11 "freedomunited.txt"
-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 37 Apr 15 14:11 "jointrewardsplux.txt"
-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 97 Apr 15 14:11 "tbills.txt"
-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 37 Apr 15 14:11 "travelrewards.txt"
-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 37 Apr 15 14:11 "worldbanccard.txt"

cattelia@Amaterasu: mv tbills.txt .../worldbanc/public/products/investments/

cattelia@Amaterasu: ls -l

-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 37 Apr 15 14:11 "creditplus.txt"
-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 37 Apr 15 14:11 "economypoints.txt"
-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 37 Apr 15 14:11 "freedomunited.txt"
-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 37 Apr 15 14:11 "jointrewardsplux.txt"
-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 37 Apr 15 14:11 "travelrewards.txt"
-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 37 Apr 15 14:11 "worldbanccard.txt"

cattelia@Amaterasu: cd ..
cattelia@Amaterasu: cd investments

cattelia@Amaterasu: ls -l

-rwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 97 Apr 15 14:11 "tbills.txt"
```

### Tip

_// If you mess up the mv command, you'll need to figure out where you accidentally moved the file to, then move it from that location back to where it belongs._

# REMOVE

The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=files-deleting-rm-command">remove command</a> ( `rm` ) deletes a file or empty directory.

- `-r` flag to delete a directory and _all_ of its contents recursively: `rm -r source_directory`
- `f` flag for force

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USING `RM`</strong></span>

After some review, we find that someone is saving passwords as plain text file. Let's secure this and delete the `passwords/` and `passwords.txt` file within it.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu: cd ../../..
cattelia@Amaterasu: private/passwords
cattelia@Amaterasu: cat passwords.txt
12345
.
.
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls
bin  cmd  contacts  customers  logs  passwords  transactions
cattelia@Amaterasu: rm -r passwords
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls
bin  cmd  contacts  customers  logs  transactions
```

_Notice how the `passwords` directory is completely gone._

# COPY

The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=c-cp-command">copy command</a> ( `cp` ) does what you would (hopefully) expect: it copies a file from one location to another.

- `R` flag to copy a directory and _all_ of its contents recursively: `cp -R source_file destination/`

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USING `CP`</strong></span>

We need to backup files in the `transactions` directory into `backups`.

```bash
# worldbanc/private/transactions/
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls backups/
2021.csv  2022.csv  2023.csv
# Year 2020 is missing!

cattelia@Amaterasu: cp 2020.csv backups/
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls backups/
2020.csv  2021.csv  2022.csv  2023.csv
# Now we have all of the backups.
```

# HOME

In a Unix-like operating system, a user's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory">home directory</a> is the directory where their personal files are stored. It is also the directory that a user starts in when logging into the system.

For example, I am currently working inside of Window Subsystem Linux on a Windows OS where all of my work is synced through Dropbox. This makes my file paths/directories unruly.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USING `~`/HOME</strong></span>

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu: pwd
/mnt/c/Users/catte/Dropbox/Tech Learning/GitHub/Boot.dev/worldbanc/
cattelia@Amaterasu: cd ~
cattelia@Amaterasu: pwd
/home/cattelia
```

## DANGER

Home directory is where you want to spend most of your time. If you are inside <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=reference-directories">other directories</a> in your machine: `/bin`, `/etc`, `/var`, you could easily mess something up.

# THE `~` ALIAS

My home directory (on Windows WSL v1) is `/home/cattelia`. The `~` character is an alias for that directory.

# GREP

Just like we are used to `ctrl+f` or `cmd+f` for Window or Mac GUIs, we can do the same in terminal.

# THE GREP COMMAND

The <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/grep-command-in-linux-unix">grep command</a> allows you to search for text in files. It has a _ton_ of capability, and we'll only be scratching the surface of its true power.

## BASIC USAGE

The most basic usage of `grep` is to search for a string in a file.

- `grep` is case sensitive. "hello" and "HELLO" will not match.

```bash
grep "hello" hello.txt
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USING `GREP`</strong></span>

We need to find "CRITICAL" inside of our logs in `/private/logs/`, use `grep` to get all of those instances.

```bash
# worldbanc/private/logs/
cattelia@Amaterasu: grep "CRITICAL" 2024-01-10.log
2024-01-10 01:10:27 CRITICAL: Boots is loose in the server room.
2024-01-10 05:58:18 CRITICAL: Server is on fire, please evacuate.
2024-01-10 20:13:04 CRITICAL: Someone rm -rf''d the root directory.
2024-01-10 20:19:37 CRITICAL: Database files are corrupt.
```

### TIP

_// The tab key is your friend! If you start typing the name of a file or directory and then press tab, your shell will try to autocomplete the name for you._

# GREP MULTIPLE FILES

You can also search multiple files at once.

```bash
grep "hello" hello.txt hello2.txt
```

## RECURSIVE SEARCH

You can also search an entire directory, including all subdirectories.

```bash
grep -r "hello" .
```

- `-r` flag to delete a directory and _all_ of its contents recursively.
- `.` is a special alias for the current directory.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USING RECURSIVE `GREP`</strong></span>

We need to find "CRITICAL" inside of our logs in `/private/logs/` recursively, use `grep` to get all of those instances.

```bash
# worldbanc/private/logs/
cattelia@Amaterasu: grep -r "CRITICAL" .
./2024-01-10.log:2024-01-10 01:10:27 CRITICAL: Boots is loose in the server room.
./2024-01-10.log:2024-01-10 05:58:18 CRITICAL: Server is on fire, please evacuate.

./2024-01-16.log:2024-01-16 00:05:21 CRITICAL: Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0).
```

# FIND

The `find` command is a powerful tool for finding files and directories by name, not by their contents.

## FIND A FILE BY NAME

You can use the `find` command to search for exactly that title:

```bash
find some_directory -name hello.txt
```

## PATTERN SEARCH

The `find` command can also search for files that match a pattern. For example, `.txt`

- `*` is a wildcard character where it catches anything.

```bash
# Find all files that have .txt file format
find some_directory -name "*.txt"

# Find all files that contain the word "chad"
find some_directory -name "*chad*"
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USING `FIND`</strong></span>

Use `find` to search through `worldbanc/public/products` for all files that contain the word "joint" in their name.

```bash
# worldbanc/public/products/
cattelia@Amaterasu: find . -name "*joint*"
./accounts/jointchecking.txt
./accounts/jointsavings.txt
./credit_cards/jointrewardsplux.txt
./loans/jointloanshark.txt
```
