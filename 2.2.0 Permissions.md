# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Learning USERS & ACCESS CONTROL</strong></span>

# USERS

Unix-like systems (like the one you're using) support multiple users. Each user has their own home directory, their own files, and their own permissions.

# SUDO

The `sudo` keyword lets you run a command as a "superuser". Short for <a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/linux-101-introduction-sudo/">"superuser do"</a>.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USING `SUDO`</strong></span>

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ whoami
cattelia
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ sudo whoami
[sudo] password for cattelia:
root
```

# PERMISSIONS

Permissions control who can do what to which files and directories. The permissions of an individual file or directory is shown as a 10-character string.

Character 1: tells you whether you're looking at a file or a directory

- `-`: Regular file (e.g. `-rwxrwxrwx`)
- `d`: Directory (e.g. `drwxrwxrwx`)

Character 2 - 9: are broken into 3 sets of `rwx` and represent the permissions themselves for the "owner", "group", and "others".

- `r`: Read
- `w`: Write
- `x`: Execute
- `-`: That action is not available

So the 3 sections are broken into 3 to determine exactly what permissions it has.
Some examples:

- `rwx`: All permissions
- `rw-`: Read and write, but not execute
- `r-x`: Read and execute, but not write

### Real life examples:

- `-rwxrwxrwx`: A file where everyone can do everything
- `-rwxr-xr-x`: A file where everyone can read and execute, but only the owner can write
- `drwxr-xr-x`: A directory where everyone can read (ls the contents) and execute (cd into it), but only the owner can write (modify the contents)
- `drwx------`: A directory where only the owner can read, write and execute

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: PRACTICE PERMISSIONS</strong></span>

```bash
# Which permissions allow everyone to read of these options?
-rwxrwx---
-rwxr-xr--
-rwx--x--x
-rwx------

# Answer
-rwxr-xr--
```

```bash
# Which permissions allow the owner to execute of these options?
-rw-rw-rw-
-rw-rw-r--
-r-xr-xr--
-r--r--r--

# Answer
-r-xr-xr--
```

# CHANGING PERMISSIONS

The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=c-chmod-command">`chmod` command</a> lets you change the permissions of a file or directory.

- `u` : user
- `g` : group
- `o` : other
- `=` : set the permissions to the following
- `r` : Read
- `w` : Write
- `x` : Execute
- `-` : That action is not available
- `g=` || `o=` : set group || set other permissions to nothing
- `-R` : recursively
- `.` : current directory

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USING `CHMOD`</strong></span>

Change the permissions of the private directory and all of its contents so that:

- The owner can read, write, and execute
- The group can do nothing
- Others can do nothing

```bash
# worldbanc/private/

cattelia@Amaterasu: ls -l
drwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 bin
drwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 cmd
drwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 contacts
drwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 customers
drwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 logs
drwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Jun  4 11:47 transactions

chmod -R u=rwx,g=,o= .
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls -l
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 bin
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 cmd
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 contacts

drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 logs
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 transactions
```

# EXECUTABLES

Files with a `.sh` extension are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script">shell scripts</a>. They're just text files that contain shell commands.

You run code through the following:

```bash
mydir/program.sh
```

If the program is in the current directory, you need the `./` prefix.

```bash
./program.sh
```

As far as file paths go, ./program.sh and program.sh are the same. _However_, We _need_ the prefix when running executables so that the shell knows we're trying to run a file from the file path.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USING `.SH` FILES</strong></span>

There is a weird file in `worldbanc` called `genids.sh`. Let's investigate it. First we want to remove our ability to run the shell file and then try running it.

```bash
# worldbanc/private/bin

# Remove ability to run shell file
cattelia@Amaterasu: chmod -x genids.sh
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls -l
-rw------- 1 cattelia cattelia 209 Apr 15 14:11 genids.sh
# Try to run the file
cattelia@Amaterasu: ./genids.sh
-bash: ./genids.sh: Permission denied
# Re-add ability to run shell file
cattelia@Amaterasu: chmod +x genids.sh
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls -l
-rwx--x--x 1 cattelia cattelia 209 Apr 15 14:11 genids.sh
cattelia@Amaterasu: ./genids.sh
ID-3478058268
ID-3441885333
ID-3439307794
ID-3388271495

# ROOT USER

The "root" user is a superuser. It has access to everything on the system and can do anything. You access this power through the `sudo` command. However, it can also be dangerous because it gives you access to everything.

### NOTE

// _Some modern systems will actually prevent you from deleting everything by default as a safeguard unless you use `--no-preserve-root`, but it's still a very bad idea._

# CHOWN

So, then the question is, "When do I _need_ to use `sudo`"? `chmod` allows us to change permission on files, but what if you don't own the file or directory? `sudo`

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USING `CHOWN`</strong></span>

There is personal content of employees inside of private but anyone can see it. Let's fix that. Let's change permission to root user.

```bash
# worldbanc/private/contacts/

cattelia@Amaterasu: ls -l

# Notice that the current owner is `cattelia`
drwxrwxrwx 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 contacts
cattelia@Amaterasu: sudo chown -R root contacts
[sudo] password for cattelia:
cattelia@Amaterasu: cd contacts/
-bash: cd: contacts/: Permission denied
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls -l

#Notice how the owner changed to `root`
drwx------ 1 root     cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 contacts
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USING `SUDO`</strong></span>

After contacting the your manager about this file, they have decided that they want to delete it all together. _Try_ to do that.

```bash
# worldbanc/private/
cattelia@Amaterasu: rm -r contacts
rm: descend into write-protected directory 'contacts'? 1
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls -l

# .../contacts/ is still there.
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 bin
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 cmd
"drwx------ 1 root     cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 contacts"
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 customers
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 logs
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 transactions

# As seen, contacts/ is owned by root now, let's sudo.
cattelia@Amaterasu: sudo rm -r contacts
cattelia@Amaterasu: ls -l

# It is no longer there.
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 bin
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 cmd
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 customers
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 logs
drwx------ 1 cattelia cattelia 4096 Apr 15 14:11 transactions
```
