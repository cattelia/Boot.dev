# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Learning Terminal and Shells</strong></span>

## ASSIGNMENT

Find and open a terminal on your computer (see below for instructions).

Once you've opened a terminal, type the following command and press enter:

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:/$ echo "Hello world"
Hello world
```

# WHAT IS A TERMINAL?

As we talked about, the terms "shell", "CLI", and "terminal" are often used to refer to the same thing: the program that lets you issue text-based commands.

However, to get pedantic, the "terminal" is just one specific part of that program. Historically, the word "terminal" meant a physical device that you could type commands into, essentially a keyboard and a screen.

These days, when we say "terminal", we really mean "terminal emulator". A terminal emulator is a program that emulates a physical terminal. It's a program that lets you type commands into a window on your computer.

Which commands you're able to use isn't determined by the terminal emulator that you happen to be using. It's determined by the "shell", which we'll talk about later.

_Your terminal emulator is just responsible for drawing text on the screen and processing your keystrokes._

# WHAT IS A SHELL?

So if your terminal is just a program that lets you issue text-based commands and renders the output of those commands...

...What is the program that runs those commands???

That's a shell.

## REPL

Shells are often referred to as "REPL"s. REPL stands for

    Read
    Eval (evaluate)
    Print
    Loop

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: ENTER PROMPTS</strong></span>

In your own shell, run the following command:

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:/$ expr 123456 + 7890

# 131346
```

# VARIABLES

- If you're using Ubuntu on WSL, you're probably running a Bash shell.
- If you're using macOS, you're probably running a Zsh shell.
- If you're running full Linux, I pray you already know what you're using.

### Create a variable

```bash
name="Sara"
```

### Use a Variable

```bash
echo $name
# Sara
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: UTILIZING VARIABLES</strong></span>

```bash

cattelia@Amaterasu:/$ bankname="WorldBanc"
cattelia@Amaterasu:/$ founded="1969"
cattelia@Amaterasu:/$ ceo="Jeff Gates"
cattelia@Amaterasu:/$ echo $bankname was founded in $founded by $ceo

# WorldBanc was founded in 1969 by Jeff Gates
```

# HISTORY

When you're working in a REPL, it's really helpful to be able to see the commands you've typed in the past. That way you can easily re-run them, or copy and paste them into a script.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: VIEW HISTORY</strong></span>

Let's take a look at your shell's history. In your shell, run the following command:

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:/$ history
 1021  sudo apt-get install build-essential libpcre3 libpcre3-dev libssl-dev
 1022  ls
 1023  cd etc/
 .
 .
 .
```

# NAVIGATE HISTORY

## ARROWS

You'll often want to re-run a command that you've run before. You could just type it out again, but assuming you don't have the WPM of ThePrimeagen, that's going to be a pain.

Instead, you can use the up and down arrows to cycle through your command history.

## CLEAR

If your terminal is feeling cluttered with text, you can clear it with the `clear` command, or by pressing `ctrl + l`. This won't delete your history, it will just clear the screen.
