# WHAT IS POLYMORPHISM?

While inheritance is the most unique trait of object-oriented languages, polymorphism is probably the most powerful. Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms.

- "poly"="many"
- "morph"="form"

For example, classes in the same hierarchical tree may have methods with the same name but different behaviors.

## SHAPES

Let's look at a simple example.

```python
class Creature():
    def move(self):
        print("the creature moves")

class Dragon(Creature):
    def move(self):
        print("the dragon flies")

class Kraken(Creature):
    def move(self):
        print("the kraken swims")

for creature in [Creature(), Dragon(), Kraken()]:
    creature.move()
# prints:
# the creature moves
# the dragon flies
# the kraken swims
```

The `Dragon` and `Kraken` child classes are overriding the behavior of their parent class's `move()` method.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

We're going to build hit-box logic for our game step by step, starting with a simple `Rectangle`.

Take a look at the test cases in `main_test.py` to see how it's expected to behave. Complete the `__init__()` method. Variables should be passed into the constructor in this order:

1. x1
2. y1
3. x2
4. y2

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):
        self.x1 = x1
        self.y1 = y1
        self.x2 = x2
        self.y2 = y2
```

```python main_test.py
from main import *

run_cases = [
    (Rectangle(0, 0, 4, 4), "corner1: (0,0) corner2: (4,4)"),
    (Rectangle(4, 4, 0, 0), "corner1: (4,4) corner2: (0,0)"),
]

submit_cases = run_cases + [
    (Rectangle(2, -2, 3, 4), "corner1: (2,-2) corner2: (3,4)"),
    (Rectangle(-1, -1, 1, 1), "corner1: (-1,-1) corner2: (1,1)"),
    (Rectangle(5, 5, 10, 10), "corner1: (5,5) corner2: (10,10)"),
    (Rectangle(-10, -10, -5, -5), "corner1: (-10,-10) corner2: (-5,-5)"),
]


def describe(rectangle):
    return f"corner1: ({rectangle.x1},{rectangle.y1}) corner2: ({rectangle.x2},{rectangle.y2})"


def test(rectangle, expected_output):
    try:
        print("---------------------------------")
        print(f"Inputs:")
        print(
            f" * rectangle corners: {rectangle.x1}, {rectangle.y1}, {rectangle.x2}, {rectangle.y2}"
        )
        print(f"Expecting: {expected_output}")
        result = describe(rectangle)
        print(f"Actual: {result}")
        if result == expected_output:
            print("Pass")
            return True
        print("Fail")
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        print("Fail")
        return False


def main():
    passed = 0
    failed = 0
    for test_case in test_cases:
        correct = test(*test_case)
        if correct:
            passed += 1
        else:
            failed += 1
    if failed == 0:
        print("============= PASS ==============")
    else:
        print("============= FAIL ==============")
    print(f"{passed} passed, {failed} failed")


test_cases = submit_cases
if "__RUN__" in globals():
    test_cases = run_cases

main()
```

# OUTPUT

```python
---------------------------------
Inputs:

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: GET EDGES</strong></span>

Remember that with normal "units" we were checking if their (x/y) point was within a rectangle (the Dragon's breath) to see if they were hit by the fire. With a dragon, because they're so big, we're going to check if the dragon's body (a rectangle) is within the fire (also a rectangle still). The image below contains an example of fire breath hitting a dragon.

In the next assignment, we'll be writing the overlap method itself. The coordinates have been made private members. First, let's set up some helper methods.

Write the following methods. What they do should be self-explanatory given their names.

`get_left_x()`
`get_right_x()`
`get_top_y()`
`get_bottom_y()`

Remember that `x1` OR `x2` could be the "left x" based on its value on the Cartesian plane. The same goes for the `y` values. You may find Python's built-in `min` and `max` functions useful if you'd rather not use the comparison operators.

### Note:

// _--repr-- will be explained later in this chapter._

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):
        self.__x1 = x1
        self.__y1 = y1
        self.__x2 = x2
        self.__y2 = y2

    def get_left_x(self):
        return self.__x1 if self.__x1 < self.__x2 else self.__x2
        #return min(self.__x1, self.__x2)

    def get_right_x(self):
        return self.__x1 if self.__x1 > self.__x2 else self.__x2
        #return max(self.__x1, self.__x2)

    def get_top_y(self):
        return self.__y1 if self.__y1 > self.__y2 else self.__y2
        #return max(self.__y1, self.__y2)

    def get_bottom_y(self):
        return self.__y1 if self.__y1 < self.__y2 else self.__y2
        #return min(self.__y1, self.__y2)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Rectangle({self.__x1}, {self.__y1}, {self.__x2}, {self.__y2})"
```

# OUTPUT

```python
---------------------------------
Inputs: Rectangle(0, 0, 4, 4)
Expecting: (0, 4, 4, 0)
Actual: (0, 4, 4, 0)
Pass
---------------------------------
Inputs: Rectangle(4, 4, 0, 0)
Expecting: (0, 4, 4, 0)
Actual: (0, 4, 4, 0)

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: CHECK IF RECTANGLES OVERLAP</strong></span>

Let's write the `overlaps()` method. It should check if this rectangle overlaps a given rectangle, rect. Return `True` if this rectangle overlaps any part of rect, including just touching sides, or `False` otherwise.

Here are four conditions that must be `True` if this rectangle (A) overlaps or touches `rect` (B):

- A's left side is on or to the left of B's right side
- A's right side is on or to the right of B's left side
- A's top side is on or above B's bottom side
- A's bottom side is on or below B's top side

```python
class Rectangle:
    def overlaps(self, rect):
        if self.get_left_x() <= rect.get_left_x() == True:
            if self.get_right_x() >= rect.get_right_x() == True:
                if self.get_top_y() >= rect.get_top_y() == True:
                    if self.get_bottom_y() <= rect.get_bottom_y() == True:
                        return True

        else:
            return False

    # From my earlier work, do not need to touch anything under here.
    def __init__(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):
        self.__x1 = x1
        self.__y1 = y1
        self.__x2 = x2
        self.__y2 = y2

    def get_left_x(self):
        return self.__x1 if self.__x1 < self.__x2 else self.__x2

    def get_right_x(self):
        return self.__x1 if self.__x1 > self.__x2 else self.__x2

    def get_top_y(self):
        return self.__y1 if self.__y1 > self.__y2 else self.__y2

    def get_bottom_y(self):
        return self.__y1 if self.__y1 < self.__y2 else self.__y2

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Rectangle({self.__x1}, {self.__y1}, {self.__x2}, {self.__y2})"
