# INHERITANCE

We've made it to the holy grail of object-oriented programming: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)">inheritance</a>. Non-OOP languages like Go and Rust allow for encapsulation and abstraction features as nearly every language does. Inheritance, on the other hand, tends to be unique to class-based languages like Python, Java, and Ruby.

## WHAT IS INHERITANCE?

Inheritance allows one class, the "child" class, to _inherit_ the properties and methods of another class, the "parent" class.

For example:
Here `Cow` is a "child" class that inherits from the "parent" class `Animal`:

```python
class Animal:
    # parent "Animal" class

class Cow(Animal):
    # child class "Cow" inherits "Animal"
```

The `Cow` class can reuse the `Animal` class's constructor with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super">super()</a> method:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, num_legs):
        self.num_legs = num_legs

class Cow(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
        # call the parent constructor to
        # give the cow some legs
        super().__init__(4)
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

In Age of Dragons, all the archers are humans, but not all humans are necessarily archers. All humans have a `name`, but only archers have a `__num_arrows` property.

Complete the `Archer` class. It should inherit the `Human` class. In its constructor it should call its parent's constructor, then also set its unique `__num_arrows` property.

```python
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name


## don't touch above this line


class Archer(Human):
    def __init__(self, name, num_arrows):
        # Coming from Human > __init__(self, name)
        self.name = super().__init__(name)
        # Standard private variable assignment
        self.__num_arrows = num_arrows

    def get_num_arrows(self):
        return self.__num_arrows
```

# OUTPUT

```python
---------------------------------
Name: Faramir | type: Human | num_arrows: None
Expecting Human: Faramir
Actual: Faramir
Pass
---------------------------------
Name: Bard | type: Archer | num_arrows: 1
Expecting Archer: Bard with 1 arrows
Actual: Bard with 1 arrows
Pass
============= PASS ==============
2 passed, 0 failed
```

# WHEN SHOULD I USE INHERITANCE?

Inheritance is a powerful tool, but it is a really bad idea to try to overuse it. Inheritance should only be used when all instances of a child class are also instances of the parent class.

When a child class inherits from a parent, it inherits **_everything_**. If you only want to share some functionality, inheritance is probably not the best answer. Better to simply share some functions, or maybe make a new parent class that both classes can inherit from.

**All cats are animals but not all animals are cats**
![alt text](img/cats.png)

# INHERITANCE HIERARCHY

There is no limit to how deeply we can nest an inheritance tree. For example, a `Cat` can inherit from an `Animal` that inherits from `LivingThing`. That said, be careful! _New programmers often get carried away._

You should never think to yourself:

```
"Well most wizards are elves... so I'll just have wizard inherit from elf"
```

A good child class is a strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset">subset</a> of its parent class.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

Let's add a new game unit: `Crossbowman`. A crossbowman is always an archer, but not all archers are crossbowmen. Crossbowmen have several arrows, but they have an additional method: `triple_shot()`.

1. Add a `use_arrows(self, num)` method to the `Archer` class. It should remove `num` arrows. If there aren't enough arrows to remove, it should raise a `not enough arrows` exception.
2. The `Crossbowman` class's constructor should call its parent's constructor.
3. The crossbowman's `triple_shot` method should use `3` arrows.
4. The crossbowman's `triple_shot` method takes a target as a parameter and returns `{} was shot by 3 crossbow bolts` where `{}` is the name of the `Human` that was shot.

```python
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

class Archer(Human):
    def __init__(self, name, num_arrows):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.__num_arrows = num_arrows

    def get_num_arrows(self):
        return self.__num_arrows
## don't touch above this line


    def use_arrows(self, num):
        if self.__num_arrows < num:
            raise Exception("not enough arrows")
        self.__num_arrows -= num


class Crossbowman(Archer):
    def __init__(self, name, num_arrows):
        super().__init__(name, num_arrows)

    def triple_shot(self, target):
        super().use_arrows(3)
        # Support from git repo comment: https://github.com/UCLL-PR2/exercises/issues/32
        return f"{target.get_name()} was shot by 3 crossbow bolts"
```

# OUTPUT

```python
---------------------------------
Creating an archer named Lara the Archer with 3 arrows
Creating a crossbowman named Marcus the Crossbowman with 2 bolts
Expected exception: not enough arrows
Caught expected exception: not enough arrows
Pass
---------------------------------
Creating an archer named Jake the Archer with 0 arrows
Creating a crossbowman named Victor the Crossbowman with 3 bolts
Jake the Archer was shot by 3 crossbow bolts
Expected 0 remaining bolts, Actual: 0
Pass
============= PASS ==============
2 passed, 0 failed
```

I was attempting to just call `target.__name` inside of `def triple_shot()` but it returned the error, `Unexpected exception: 'Archer' object has no attribute '_Crossbowman__name'`. This is because the `.__name` is inherited all the way up to `Human` parent class, which has a getter function, `get_name`.

# REVIEW

### Inheritance needs to encapsule **all** of the characterstics of the parent, not just some.

![alt text](img/InheritanceReview.png)

### Example of inheritance in code:

```python
class RealEstate:
    def __init__(self, location):
        self.__location = location


class Residential(RealEstate):
    def __init__(self, location, bedrooms):
        super().__init__(location)
        self.__bedrooms = bedrooms


class House(Residential):
    def __init__(self, location, bedrooms, yard_size):
        super().__init__(location, bedrooms)
        self.__yard_size = yard_size
```

# MULTIPLE CHILDREN

So far we've worked with linear class inheritance, but usually, inheritance hierarchies form trees, not lines. A parent class can have multiple children.

![alt text](img/MultiChildren.png)

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: ARCHER</strong></span>

The `Archer` class should inherit from `Hero`. Fulfill the following requirements from the game designers:

- `Archer` should inherit from `Hero`
- `Archer` should set up the hero's name and health
- Set a private "number of arrows" variable that can be passed in as a third parameter to the constructor.
- Create a `shoot` method that takes a target hero as input. If there are no arrows left, raise a `not enough arrows` exception. Otherwise, remove an arrow and deal `10` damage to the target hero.

```python
class Hero:
    def __init__(self, name, health):
        self.__name = name
        self.__health = health

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

    def get_health(self):
        return self.__health

    def take_damage(self, damage):
        self.__health -= damage


class Archer(Hero):
    def __init__(self, name, health, num_arrows):

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: WIZARD</strong></span>

Let's extend the Hero class by adding a second child class: the Wizard. Wizard heroes are more powerful than archer heroes. They cast spells at other heroes instead of shooting them, and casting does 25 damage instead of 10 but also costs 25 mana.

Fulfill the following requirements.

- `Wizard` should inherit from Hero
- `Wizard` should set up the hero's name and health
- Set a private "mana" variable that can be passed in as a third parameter to the constructor.
- Create a `cast` method that takes a target hero as input. If there is not enough mana left, raise a `not enough mana` exception. Otherwise, remove `25` mana from the wizard and deal `25` damage to the target hero.

```python
# From earlier work
class Hero:
    def __init__(self, name, health):
        self.__name = name
        self.__health = health

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

    def get_health(self):
        return self.__health

    def take_damage(self, damage):
        self.__health -= damage


class Archer(Hero):
    def __init__(self, name, health, num_arrows):
        super().__init__(name, health)
        self.__num_arrows = num_arrows

    def shoot(self, target):
        if self.__num_arrows <= 0:
            raise Exception("not enough arrows")
        self.__num_arrows -= 1
        target.take_damage(10)

# Figure this out
class Wizard(Hero):
    def __init__(self, name, health, mana):
        # Inherit the name and health from Hero parent
        super().__init__(name, health)
        # initialize private `mana` variable
        self.__mana = mana

    def cast(self, target):
        # The cost of a mana spell is 25
        if self.__mana < 25:
            raise Exception("not enough mana")
        self.__mana -= 25

# INHERITANCE BUILD REVIEW

You'll often find that it's more likely that an inheritance tree is wide than deep. In other words, instead of a deep tree like:
![alt text](img/DeepvsWideInheritance.png)

### WHY ARE INHERITANCE TREES OFTEN WIDE INSTEAD OF DEEP?

As we talked about earlier, in good software a child class is a strict subset of its parent class. In a deep tree, that means the children need to be perfect members of all the parent class "types". That simply doesn't happen very often in the real world. It's much more likely that you'll have a base class that simply has many sibling classes that are slightly different variations of the base.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: DRAGONS</strong></span>

In "Age of Dragons", there are Orcs, Humans, Goblins, Dragons, etc. All of those different creatures are called "units". At the moment, the only thing specific to a unit is that it has a `position` on the game map and a `name`.

Dragons, a specific type of unit, can breathe fire in a large area dealing damage to any units that are touched by its fiery blaze.

## THE GAME GRID

Our game map is just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system">Cartesian plane</a>.

![alt text](img/cartesian_plane_1.png)
<br>

Complete the unit's `in_area` method and the dragon's `breathe_fire` method.

### `IN_AREA`

This method has four parameters, `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2` and `y_2`. Where `x_1` and `y_1` make up the bottom-left point of the rectangle and `x_2` and `y_2` define the top-right point.

Use the unit's `pos_x` and `pos_y` to determine if it is inside or touching the rectangle, if so, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

### `BREATH_FIRE`

This method causes the dragon to breathe a swath of fire in the target area. The target area is centered at `(x,y)`. The area stretches for `__fire_range` in both directions inclusively.

For each unit in the `units` list, append that unit to a list if the unit is within the blast. `Return` the list of units hit by the blast.

### EXAMPLE OF FIRE BREATHING HITTING A UNIT

The example above uses a `__fire_range` of `1` centered at `(1, 1)`.

![alt text](img/cartesian_plane_2.png)

<br>

```python
class Unit:
    def __init__(self, name, pos_x, pos_y):
        self.name = name
        self.pos_x = pos_x
        self.pos_y = pos_y

    def in_area(self, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2):
        # (.pos_x, .pos_y) are the coordinates of player
        if self.pos_x < x_1 or self.pos_x > x_2:
            return False
        elif self.pos_y < y_1 or self.pos_y > y_2:
            return False
        else:
            return True

class Dragon(Unit):
    def __init__(self, name, pos_x, pos_y, fire_range):
        super().__init__(name, pos_x, pos_y)
        self.__fire_range = fire_range

    def breathe_fire(self, x, y, units):
        # List of units that are struck by the fire_blast
        units_hit_by_fire = []
        # (x,y) center of blast -> x +- fire_range and y +- fire_range
        #    needed for in_area(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) method
        fire_x1 = x - self.__fire_range
        fire_y1 = y - self.__fire_range
        fire_x2 = x + self.__fire_range
        fire_y2 = y + self.__fire_range

        for unit in units:
            if unit.in_area(fire_x1, fire_y1, fire_x2, fire_y2) == True:
                units_hit_by_fire.append(unit)

        return units_hit_by_fire
```

# OUTPUT

```python

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: DRAGONS II</strong></span>

Let's have ourselves a little dragon fight. Complete the bottom half of the main() function using two for-loops.

1. In the first for-loop, `describe()` all of the dragons, starting with the first dragon in the list and ending with the last dragon in the list.
2. In the next for-loop, have each dragon `breathe_fire` at coordinate `x=3, y=3`. Pass in all of the other dragons (not the one breathing fire) as the `units` parameter so we can see if they get hit.

Pass in the dragons in ascending index order. For example, when `Blue Dragon` breathes fire, it should breathe fire on the other dragons in this order:

- Green Dragon
- Red Dragon
- Black Dragon

### TIPS

// _COPYING A LIST: To get a new copy of a list, use the `copy()` method. If you don't, your new variable will just be a reference to the original list._

```python
nums = [4, 3, 2, 1]
nums_copy = nums.copy()
# nums_copy is [4, 3, 2, 1]
```

// _DELETING FROM A LIST:_

```python
nums = [4, 3, 2, 1]
del nums[1]
# nums is [4, 2, 1]
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Optional Challenge</strong></span>

## RECTANGLES

You discovered that to properly calculate army formations in the game, you needed to be able to get the area and perimeter of squares and rectangles of various sizes.

## CHALLENGE

Finish implementing the empty methods of the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes. All squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares.

### NOTE:

// _Due to inheritance of methods, the `Square` class should only need to implement the `__init__` method._

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def get_area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

    def get_perimeter(self):
        return self.length + self.width + self.length + self.width


class Square(Rectangle):
    def __init__(self, length):
        super().__init__(length, length)
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Optional Challenge</strong></span>

## CARAVAN

Siege weapons (battering rams, catapults, etc) are special units in Age of Dragons. Let's write the logic for how they move around the map. Let's complete the `Siege`, `BatteringRam`, and `Catapult` classes.

## SIEGE CLASS

### CONSTRUCTOR

Accepts two parameters (in order) and sets them as instance variables:

- `max_speed`
- `efficiency`

### `GET_TRIP_COST()`

Calculates the cost of a trip:

```python
(distance / efficiency) * food_price
```

_It costs food to move siege weapons, those things are heavy!_

### `GET_CARGO_VOLUME()`

This method should be left empty. Use the pass keyword. Child classes will override this method.

## BATTERINGRAM CLASS

### CONSTRUCTOR

Calls the parent constructor, then sets the extra battering-ram-only instance variables as member variables.

### `GET_TRIP_COST()`

Uses the parent method to calculate the cost of food for a trip, plus the extra cost of carrying a load.

The formula for calculating the cost:

```python
base_cost + (load_weight * 0.01)
```

### `GET_CARGO_VOLUME()`

Returns the cargo capacity in meters cubed. Get the volume of the battering-ram's "bed" (cargo area) by multiplying its area and depth. Every bed is 2 meters deep.

## CATAPULT CLASS

### CONSTRUCTOR

Calls the parent constructor, then sets the extra catapult-only instance variable as a member variable.

### `GET_TRIP_COST()`

Do not override this method.

### `GET_CARGO_VOLUME()`

Just returns the cargo capacity of the catapult. This is already set by the constructor.

## Assignment

```python
class Siege:
    def __init__(self, max_speed, efficiency):
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.efficiency = efficiency

    def get_trip_cost(self, distance, food_price):
        return (distance / self.efficiency) * food_price

    def get_cargo_volume(self):
        pass


class BatteringRam(Siege):
    def __init__(self, max_speed, efficiency, load_weight, bed_area):
        # Inherit from Parent "Siege"
        super().__init__(max_speed, efficiency)
        # Instance variables
        self.load_weight = load_weight
        self.bed_area = bed_area

    def get_trip_cost(self, distance, food_price):
        # base_cost + (load_weight * 0.01)
        return ((distance / self.efficiency) * food_price) + (self.load_weight * 0.01)

    def get_cargo_volume(self):
        # Every bed is 2 meters deep.
        return self.bed_area * 2


class Catapult(Siege):
    def __init__(self, max_speed, efficiency, cargo_volume):
        super().__init__(max_speed, efficiency)
        self.cargo_volume = cargo_volume

    def get_cargo_volume(self):
        return self.cargo_volume
```

# OUTPUT

```python
---------------------------------
Testing Siege: Max Speed 100 kph, Efficiency 10 km/food
Distance: 100 km, Price: 4 per food
Expected: Trip Cost: 40, Cargo Volume: None
  Actual: Trip Cost: 40, Cargo Volume: None
Pass
---------------------------------
Testing BatteringRam: Max Speed 100 kph, Efficiency 10 km/food
Distance: 100 km, Price: 5 per food
Expected: Trip Cost: 70, Cargo Volume: 10
  Actual: Trip Cost: 70, Cargo Volume: 10
Pass
---------------------------------
Testing Catapult: Max Speed 100 kph, Efficiency 10 km/food
Distance: 100 km, Price: 6 per food
Expected: Trip Cost: 60, Cargo Volume: 2
  Actual: Trip Cost: 60, Cargo Volume: 2
Pass
============= PASS ==============
3 passed, 0 failed
