# INHERITANCE

We've made it to the holy grail of object-oriented programming: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)">inheritance</a>. Non-OOP languages like Go and Rust allow for encapsulation and abstraction features as nearly every language does. Inheritance, on the other hand, tends to be unique to class-based languages like Python, Java, and Ruby.

## WHAT IS INHERITANCE?

Inheritance allows one class, the "child" class, to _inherit_ the properties and methods of another class, the "parent" class.

For example:
Here `Cow` is a "child" class that inherits from the "parent" class `Animal`:

```python
class Animal:
    # parent "Animal" class

class Cow(Animal):
    # child class "Cow" inherits "Animal"
```

The `Cow` class can reuse the `Animal` class's constructor with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super">super()</a> method:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, num_legs):
        self.num_legs = num_legs

class Cow(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
        # call the parent constructor to
        # give the cow some legs
        super().__init__(4)
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

In Age of Dragons, all the archers are humans, but not all humans are necessarily archers. All humans have a `name`, but only archers have a `__num_arrows` property.

Complete the `Archer` class. It should inherit the `Human` class. In its constructor it should call its parent's constructor, then also set its unique `__num_arrows` property.

```python
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name


## don't touch above this line


class Archer(Human):
    def __init__(self, name, num_arrows):
        pass

    def get_num_arrows(self):
        return self.__num_arrows
```
