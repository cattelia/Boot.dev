# CHALLENGE 2: DECK OF CARDS

## ASSIGNMENT

Finish the `DeckOfCards` class. The `SUITS` and` RANKS` of each card have been provided for you as class variables. You won't need to modify them, but you will need to use them.

```python
import random


class DeckOfCards:
    SUITS = ["Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades"]
    RANKS = [
        "Ace",
        "2",
        "3",
        "4",
        "5",
        "6",
        "7",
        "8",
        "9",
        "10",
        "Jack",
        "Queen",
        "King",
    ]
```

## CONSTRUCTOR

1. Initialize a `private` empty list called `cards`.
2. Fill that empty list by calling the `create_deck` method within the constructor.

```python
    def __init__(self):
        self.__cards = []
        self.create_deck()
```

## `CREATE_DECK(SELF)`

This method should create a `(Rank, Suit)` tuple for all 52 cards in the deck and append them to the `cards` list.

_Order matters! The cards should be appended to the list in the following order: all ranks of hearts, then diamonds, then clubs, and finally spades. Within each suit, the cards should be ordered from lowest rank (Ace) to highest rank (King)._

```python
# Refer to `tuple_comprehension_test.py` to see work through.
def create_deck(self):
    for symbol in DeckOfCards.SUITS:
        for card in DeckOfCards.RANKS:
            self.__cards.append((card, symbol))
```

## `SHUFFLE_DECK(SELF)`

This method should use the random.shuffle() method (available from the random package) to shuffle the `cards` in the deck.

```python
def shuffle_deck(self):
    # Shuffle the sequence x in place using `random.shuffle(x)`
    new_shuffled_deck = random.shuffle(self.__cards)
```

## `DEAL_CARD(SELF)`

This method should `.pop()` the first card off the top of the deck (top of the deck is the end of the list) and return it. If there are no cards left in the deck the method should instead return `None`.

```python
def deal_card(self):
    if len(self.__cards) == 0:
        return None
    else:
        return self.__cards.pop()

def __str__(self):
    return f"The deck has {len(self.__cards)} cards"
```

# OUTPUT

```python
Testing action: shuffle_deck, dealing 3 cards
Expected Output:
* 9 of Hearts
* Jack of Clubs
* 10 of Spades
Shuffling deck...
dealing 3 cards
Actual Output:
* 9 of Hearts
* Jack of Clubs
* 10 of Spades
Pass
```
