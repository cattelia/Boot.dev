# WHAT IS OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING?

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object-Oriented Programming</a>, or "OOP", is a pattern for writing clean and maintainable code. Not everyone agrees that object-oriented principles are the best way to write code, but, to be a good engineer, you should at least understand them.

In this course, we'll be coding the pieces of a real-time strategy game called "Age of Dragons". Players control armies of people, elves, orcs, and dragons and battle each other. It's similar to Age of Empires or StarCraft.

## LOOK AT THIS CODE

```python
def destroy_wall(wall_health):
    for w in wall_health:
        if w <= 0:
            wall_health.remove(w)
    return wall_health
```

One of the greatest sins when trying to write "clean code" is using misleading names for your variables and functions. Take a look at the `destroy_wall` function. Based on its name, you might assume that it destroys a single wall, but if you look closely, you'll see that it handles multiple walls.

### Fix this:

```python
def destroy_walls(wall_health):
    for w in wall_health:
        if w <= 0:
            wall_health.remove(w)
    return wall_health
```
