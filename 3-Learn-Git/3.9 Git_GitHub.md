# GITHUB REPOSITORY

GitHub is the most popular website for Git repositories (projects) online. That is, for hosting "remotes" on a central website. GitHub serves several purposes:

- As a backup of all your code on the cloud in case something happens to your computer
- As a central place to share your code and collaborate on it with others
- As a public portfolio for your coding projects

# GIT != GITHUB

**_It's important to understand that Git and GitHub are not the same!_** Git is an open-source command line tool for managing code files. GitHub and its primary competitors, GitLab and Bitbucket, are commercial web products that use Git. Their websites give us a way to store our code that's managed by Git.

# GITHUB REPO

Just like we created a `webflyx-local` repo and used `webflyx` as a remote, GitHub makes it easy to create "remotes" that are hosted on their site.

1. Create new repo on GitHub named, `webflyx` and leave blank
2. Authenticate your local Git config on GitHub account. _(Use `Webi` tp download GitHub CLI)_

```bash
curl -sS https://webi.sh/gh | sh
```

3. Make sure you are logged in.

```bash
gh auth login
```

4. Navigate back into your `webflyx` repo locally, it's going to be our "local" repo, you can forget about or delete `webflyx-local` if you want.
5. <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote">Add a remote</a> to your `webflyx` repo that points to the `webflyx-remote` repo you just created. That command should look something like this:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/webflyx.git
```

_Be sure to replace your-username with your actual GitHub username!_ 5. Run git ls-remote to make sure the remote was added correctly.

### Try it myself

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ curl -sS https://webi.sh/gh | sh

cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ sudo rm -r ~/webflyx-local/
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ ls
Downloads  github  go  webflyx  worldbanc

# Go into `webflyx`
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ cd webflyx/
# Add a remote to `webflyx`
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git remote add origin https://github.com/cattelia/webflyx.git
# Verify
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git ls-remote
# From https://github.com/cattelia/webflyx.git

# Send test packages
All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

# GIT PUSH

The `git` push command pushes (sends) local changes to any "remote" - in our case, GitHub. For example, to push our local `main` branch's commits to the remote `origin`'s `main` branch we would run:

```bash
git push origin main
```

_You need to be authenticated with the remote to push changes, which you should have done in the last lesson._

# ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS

You can also push a local branch to a remote with a different name: _It's less common to do this, but nice to know._

```bash
git push origin <localbranch>:<remotebranch>
```

You can also _delete_ a remote branch by pushing an empty branch to it:

```bash
git push origin :<remotebranch>
```

### Try it myself

cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git push origin main

 * [new branch]      main -> main
```

# PULL

Fetching is nice, but most of the time we want the actual file changes from a remote repo, not just the metadata.

## COMMAND SYNTAX

```bash
git pull [<remote>/<branch>]
```

The syntax `[...]` means that the bracketed remote and branch are optional. If you execute git pull without anything specified it will pull your current branch from the remote repo.

### Try it myself

Let's use the GitHub UI to commit a change to our remote repo. Then we'll pull that change down to our local repo.

1. Navigate to your GitHub repo in your browser
2. Navigate to the `classics.csv` file on the main branch
3. In the top right corner, click "Edit this file"
4. Add a new line to the end of the file:

```bash
Willow, Ron Howard, 1988
```

5. Commit the change using the UI, but change the message to: "J: Update classics.csv"
6. On your command line, make sure you're on your `main` branch.
7. `merge` the changes from the `update_dune` branch back into main so that main has everything we've done so far (A through I)
8. Run `git pull origin main` to pull in the most recent "J" commit that you made remotely (If you get a "divergent branches" error, run `git config pull.rebase false` to make sure git will merge on a pull, then try again.)
9. You should see that it starts a merge commit. Rename the merge commit message to start with `K:`
10. Make sure everything worked with `git log --oneline`. You should have commits "A" through "K" locally.

```bash
# Steps 1 - 5 is on GitHub
# Make sure I am on the `main` branch
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git branch

# PULL REQUESTS

On GitHub, a pull request is a way to propose some changes. It's very common to use pull requests if you want to make changes to an open source project, or if you're working on a team.

Pull requests allow team members to see what changes are being proposed and to discuss them before they are merged into the main codebase.

```bash
# Make a new branch
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git branch
* main
  update_dune
  update_titles
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git switch -c add_classics
Switched to a new branch 'add_classics'
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git branch
* add_classics
  main
  update_dune
  update_titles

# Add new line to "classics.csv", stage, and commit with "L:"
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ nano classics.csv
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git add ./classics.csv
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git commit -m "L: update classics.csv"

# LANE'S WORKFLOW

We've covered a lot of Git basics. There's certainly more you can learn, but this will give you a solid foundation to work with as a developer. If you want more, there will be a part 2 of this course released soon where we'll cover more advanced topics.

All that said, I want to leave you with a note on my simple workflow. 90% Of the time, you're only using a handful of git commands to get your coding work done.

# KEEP STUFF ON GITHUB

I keep all my serious projects on GitHub. That way if my computer explodes, I have a backup, and if I'm ever on another computer, I can just clone the repo and get back to work.

# REBASE VS MERGE

I've configured Git to rebase by default on pull, rather than merge so I keep a linear history. If you want to do the same, you can add this to your global Git config:

```bash
git config --global pull.rebase true
```

# LANE'S SOLO WORKFLOW

When I'm working by myself, I usually stick to a single branch, `main`. I mostly use Git on solo projects to keep a backup remotely and to keep a history of my changes. I only rarely use separate branches.

1. Make changes to files
2. `git add . `(or `git add <files>` if I only want to add specific files)
3. `git commit -m "a message describing the changes"`
4. `git push origin main`

It really is that simple for most solo work. `git log`, `git reset`, and some others are of course useful from time to time, but the above is the core of what I do day-to-day.

# LANE'S TEAM WORKFLOW

### AND WHAT I CAN EXPECT IN PROFESSIONAL SETTING

When you're working with a team Git gets a bit more involved (and we'll cover more of this in part 2 of this course). Here's what I do:

- Update my local `main` branch with `git pull origin main`
- Checkout a new branch for the changes I want to make with `git switch -c <branchname>`
- Make changes to files
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "a message describing the changes"`
- `git push origin <branchname>` (I push to the new branch name, not main)
- Open a pull request on GitHub to merge my changes into `main`
- Ask a team member to review my pull request
- Once approved, click the "Merge" button on GitHub to merge my changes into `main`
- Delete my feature branch, and repeat with a new branch for the next set of changes
