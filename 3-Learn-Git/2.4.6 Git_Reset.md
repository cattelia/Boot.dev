# UNDOING CHANGES

One of the major benefits of using Git is the ability to undo changes. There are a lot of different ways to do this, but for now, we'll focus on the simplest thing: destroying current work and just going back.

### Try it myself

The new intern at Webflyx accidentally deleted the `titles.md` file! To simulate that, go ahead and delete it.

```bash
# Notice that the file is still here
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ ls
classics.csv  contents.md  quotes  titles.md
# Simulating deleted file
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ rm titles.md
# Now it is gone
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ ls
classics.csv  contents.md  quotes
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git status
On branch update_dune
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    titles.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

# GIT RESET

The <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset">git reset</a> command can be used to reset any changes in the index (staged but not committed changes) and the worktree (unstaged and not committed changes).

```bash
git reset --hard
```

This is useful if you just want to discard all your current changes and go back to the last commit.

### Try it myself

```bash
# Start where I left off, `titles.md` deleted by intern
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git status
On branch update_dune
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    titles.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
# Run `git reset --hard` to discard everything and recover lost files
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git reset --hard
HEAD is now at 1684334 I: update dune.md

# Check that `titles.md` is back
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ cat titles.md
# Titles

* A River Runs Through It
* Fight Club
* 12 Years a Slave
* The Big Short
* 12 Monkeys
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"

# Send test packages
All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

# DANGER

I want to stress how **dangerous** this command can be. When you deleted the file, because it was tracked in Git, it was trivially easy to recover. However, if you have some changes that you _do_ want to keep, running `git reset --hard` will delete them for good.

_**Always be careful when using `git reset --hard`. It's a powerful tool, but it's also a dangerous one.**_

# RESET TO A SPECIFIC COMMIT

If you want to reset back to a specific commit, you can use the `git reset --hard` command and provide a commit hash. For example:

```bash
git reset --hard a1b2c3d
```

This will reset your working directory and index to the state of that commit, and all the changes made after that commit are lost forever.

Again, be _super careful_ with this. In part 2 of this course, we'll cover more advanced (read: safer) ways to undo changes.

### Let's answer questions on what I learned

```bash
# Git reset --hard _____
undoes uncommitted changes, deleting the changes forever

# When provided a hash, git reset --hard _____
Moves your current branch back to an older commit and destructively discards uncommitted changes
```
