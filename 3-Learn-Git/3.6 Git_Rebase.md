# REBASE

"<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">Rebase</a> vs <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge">Merge</a>" is one of the most hotly debated topics in the Git world. A lot of the discussions you'll see online come down to the fact that many developers (yes, even professionals) don't understand the purpose of rebase and use it incorrectly, causing a bunch of Git havoc, and then blame the rebase command.

_It's not Git's fault, it's a skill issue._ - "Lane"

## Visualizing Rebase

Say we have this commit history:

```bash
A - B - C    main
   \
    D - E    feature_branch
```

We're working on `feature_branch`, and want to bring in the changes our team added to `main` so we're not working with a stale branch. We could merge `main` into `feature_branch`, but that would create an additional merge commit. Rebase avoids a merge commit by replaying the commits from `feature_branch` on top of `main`. After a rebase, the history will look like this:

```bash
A - B - C         main
         \
          D - E   feature_branch
```

### Answer some questions with what I learned

```bash
# Both rebase and merge can be used to integrate changes from one branch into another.
True

# ____ can add an additional commit, ____ does not
merge, rebase
```

# NEW BRANCH

We need a new feature branch, but to be able to practice a rebase, we want it to _not_ include some of the recent commits on `main`.

### Try it myself

1. Use `git switch` command to create and switch to a new branch called `update_dune`, but branch off of the `D` commit.
   _You can supply the commit hash directly to the git switch command:_

```bash
git switch -c update_dune COMMITHASH
```

2. Replace `COMMITHASH` with the hash of the `D` commit. \_This can be grabbed by the `git log` command.
3. Verify with `git log --oneline -n 1` that you are on the new branch and that `D` is the last commit.

```bash
# Verify I am on main so I can start looking for the right hash.
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git branch
* main
  update_titles
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git log

    D: add classics.csv

# Create new branch from `main:D` called `update_dune`
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git switch -c update_dune 2df649cbd7f966499baf93b41d080215f4da6926
Switched to a new branch 'update_dune'

# Verify that the new branch is created and on `D`
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git log --oneline -n 1
2df649c (HEAD -> update_dune) #D: add classics.csv

# Send test packages
All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

# RUN REBASE

To use rebase to bring changes from a branch called `tomsagenius` onto the current branch (let's call it `jdsl`), we would run this while on the `jdsl` branch:

```bash
git rebase tomsagenius
```

This will do the following:

1. Checkout the latest commit on `tomsagenius`
2. Replay one commit at a time from `jdsl` onto `tomsagenius`
3. Update the `jdsl` branch to point to the last replayed commit

### Try it myself

1. Add two commits to the `update_dune` branch. Add the following quotes to the `quotes/dune.md` file's list:
   - "The spice must flow." (Use a commit message starting with H:)
   - "Fear is the mind-killer." (Use a commit message starting with I:)
2. While still on the `update_dune` branch, rebase your changes onto `main`. (`main` is the base, and we want `update_dune`'s changes on top of it.)
3. Run `git log --oneline`. _Even though we branched off the `D` commit on main, we should see a nice linear history from `A` to `I`._

```bash
# Gather where I am in `git`, notice I am on the new branch `update_dune`
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git branch
  main
* update_dune
  update_titles
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ ls
classics.csv  contents.md  quotes  titles.md
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ cd quotes/
# Add the first new line to "dune.md"
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx/quotes$ nano dune.md
# "The spice must flow."

# WHEN TO REBASE

`git rebase` and `git merge` are different tools.

An advantage of merge is that it preserves the true history of the project. It shows when branches were merged and where. One disadvantage is that it can create a lot of merge commits, which can make the history harder to read and understand.

A linear history is generally easier to read, understand, and work with. Some teams enforce the usage of one or the other on their `main` branch, but generally speaking, you'll be able to do whatever you want with your own branches.

## WARNING

You should _never_ rebase a **public** branch (like `main`) onto anything else. Other developers have it checked out, and if you change its history, you'll cause a lot of problems for them.

However, with your **own** branch, you can rebase onto other branches (including a public branch like `main`) as much as you want.
