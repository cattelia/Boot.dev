# GIT CLONE

Let's clone down the GitHub repo onto your machine and open it in your editor.

By creating a project on GitHub first and cloning it down, the remote connection between your local project and GitHub will be configured automatically. If you start your project on your local machine and push it up later, there are a few more steps involved. That's why I prefer `git clone` to `git init` + `git remote add origin`.

## WORKSPACE STRUCTURE

1. Navigate to your workspace root, make sure you're in your `workspace` directory.

```bash
cd ~/workspace
```

2. Create and navigate into a directory called github.com. This is where all GitHub projects will live:

```bash
mkdir github.com
cd github.com
```

3. Create and navigate into a directory that will hold all the projects owned by your GitHub username. Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username:

```bash
mkdir USERNAME
cd USERNAME
```

All of your personal projects on GitHub will now live here, at `~/workspace/github.com/username`. I like to structure my workspace this way because it makes it easy to find and manage all my projects, and it means I'll never have conflicting project names (because it mirrors the remote URL structure).

## OPTIONAL: SYMLINK

Since, I already have a github workspace synced within Dropbox, I want to make my life easier by just symlinking to WSL home directory.

```bash
# Run this in the directory I want the symlink to live
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/Github$ ln --symbolic "path/to/directory/" "Symbolic Name"
```

# STEPS TO CLONING

1. Make a Github Repository through github.com
   - Make it public
   - _Optional: add a `README.md`_
2. Clone the `bookbot` repo by running this command inside of `USERNAME` directory and replacing it with the github username.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/Github$ git clone https://github.com/cattelia/bookbot
Cloning into 'bookbot'...

remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.

cattelia@Amaterasu:~/Github$ ls
...
Boot.dev
bookbot

# Send test packages
All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

# RE-OPEN VS CODE

VS Code's tooling works best if you open VS Code to the root of the repository you're working on. In the VS Code menu, use `file -> open folder` then navigate to and open your "bookbot" directory (which is in `~/workspace/github.com/USERNAME/bookbot`). If all goes well, you should see a `README.md` file in your file explorer on the left.
