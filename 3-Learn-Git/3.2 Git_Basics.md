# <span style="color:#0F77A5">**THE PORCELAIN**</span>

# CONFIG

The very first step of any project is to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories">create a repository</a>. A Git "repository" (or "repo") represents a single project. You'll typically have one repository for each project you work on.

A repo is essentially just a directory that contains a project (other directories and files). The only difference is that it also contains a hidden `.git` directory. That <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory">hidden directory</a> is where Git stores all of its internal tracking and versioning information for the project.

## WEBFLYX

In this course, we'll be managing content for "WebFlyx", an imaginary self-hosted video streaming application. WebFlyx serves content directly from a Git repo!

```bash
# Make a new directory to pracitce `git` with.
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ mkdir webflyx
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ lsd
Û∞âç Downloads  ÔÑï github  ÔíÇ go  ÔÑï webflyx  ÔÑï worldbanc  Ôêê worldbanc.zip
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ cd webflyx/

# Create a new repository
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/cattelia/webflyx/.git/

# Check if `.git` file is there
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ lsd -a
ÔÑï .  ÔÑï ..  Óóª .git

# Send test packages
All tests passed! üéâ
```

# STATUS

A file can be in one of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_the_very_basics">several states</a> in a Git repository. Here are a few important ones:

- `untracked`: Not being tracked by Git
- `staged`: Marked for inclusion in the next commit
- `committed`: Saved to the repository's history

The `git status` command shows you the current state of your repo. It will tell you which files are untracked, staged, and committed.

```bash
# Make a Markdown file (.md) in the root of `webflyx` and check it
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ nano
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ lsd
Óòâ contents.md
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        contents.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

# Send test packages
All tests passed! üéâ
```

# STAGING

The `contents.md` file has been created, but as we saw, it's _untracked_. We need to stage it (add it to the "index") with the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add">git add</a> command before committing it later.

Without staging, every file in the repository would be included in every commit, but that's often not what you want.

Here's the command:

`git add <path-to-file | pattern>`

```bash
# Stage the work we can to commit to `git`
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git add ./contents.md
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        #new file:   contents.md

# Send test packages
All tests passed! üéâ
```

# COMMIT

After staging a file, we can <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits">commit</a> it.

A commit is a snapshot of the repository at a given point in time. It's a way to save the state of the repository, and it's how Git keeps track of changes to the project. A commit comes with a message that describes the changes made in the commit.

**Here's how to commit all of your staged files:**

`git commit -m "your message here`

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git commit -m "A: add contents.md"
[master (root-commit) 2eba3e1] A: add contents.md
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 contents.md
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

# Send test packages
All tests passed! üéâ
```

### TIP

// _If you screw up a commit message, you can change it with the `--amend `flag. **For example:**_

```bash
# Change the last commit message
git commit --amend -m "A: add contents.md"
```

# HALF OF GIT

I've learned half of Git (...well, not really. But kind of.).

Half of your workflow as a developer will just be 3 simple commands:

- `git status`
- `git add`
- `git commit`

It's most of what you need to work effectively as a solo developer. Another 40% of Git is about collaborating and storing your work on a remote server.

The last 10% is mostly about fixing mistakes, rolling back changes, and other advanced topics. Don't worry, we'll cover those too.

# GIT LOG

A Git repo is a (potentially very long) list of commits, where each commit represents the _full state of the repository_ at a given point in time.

The <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log">git log</a> command shows a history of the commits in a repository. This is what makes Git a version control system. You can see:

- Who made a commit
- When the commit was made
- What was changed

## A COMMIT HASH

Each commit has a unique identifier called a "commit hash". This is a long string of characters that uniquely identifies the commit. Here's an example of one:

```git
5ba786fcc93e8092831c01e71444b9baa2228a4f
```

For convenience you can refer to any commit using the first `7` character of its hash. (`5ba786f`)

```bash
# Just run `git log`
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git log
commit 2eba3e15e5d39122e6e5b9c3a8dce8eaa54d0af5 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Sara <cattelia@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 14 00:32:57 2024 -0700

    A: add contents.md

# Run `git log` with pager restrictions

Date:   Fri Jun 14 00:32:57 2024 -0700

    A: add contents.md

# Send test packages

```

# DIFFERENT HASHES

You may have noticed that even though we (you and I) both have the same content in our repositories, we have different commit hashes. While commit hashes are derived from their content changes, there's also some other stuff that affects the end hash. For example:

- The commit message
- The author's name and email
- The date and time
- Parent (previous) commit hashes

All this to say that hashes are (almost) always unique, and because they're generated automatically for you, you don't need to worry too much about what goes into them right now.

### NOTE: HASH = SHA

_Git uses a cryptographic hash function called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1</a> to generate commit hashes. We won't go into the details of how SHA-1 works in this course, but it's important to know because you might also hear commit hashes referred to as "SHAs"._

# <span style="color:#0F77A5">**THE PLUMBING**</span>

So far we've been using Git in a "porcelain" manner. But to sate our insatiable curiosity, let's take a look at some of the "plumbing".

# _"IT'S JUST FILES ALL THE WAY DOWN"_

All the data in a Git repository is stored directly in the (hidden) `.git` directory. That includes all the commits, branches, tags, and other objects we'll learn about later.

Git is made up of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">objects</a> that are stored in the `.git/objects` directory. A commit is just a type of object.

```bash
# Get your latest git Hash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git log

ÔÄñ ba3e15e5d39122e6e5b9c3a8dce8eaa54d0af5
```

# THE OBJECT FILE

Let's take a look at what's inside this suspicious commit object file.

```bash
# The contents have been compressed to raw bytes!
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/...2e$ cat ba3e15e5d39122e6e5b9c3a8dce8eaa54d0af5

```

The contents are compressed, let's try again with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/xxd">xxd</a> command to print out the contents of the file in hexadecimal format.

```bash
# Run `xxd` on the file which turns it into hexadecimal format

# CAT FILE

Luckily, Git has a built-in plumbing command, <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cat-file">cat-file</a>, that allows us to see the contents of a commit without needing to futz around with the object files directly. For exmaple:

```bash
git cat-file -p <hash>
```

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ cd ~
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ cd webflyx/
# Get the last commit hash I made
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git log
"commit 2eba3e15e5d39122e6e5b9c3a8dce8eaa54d0af5 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Sara <cattelia@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 14 00:32:57 2024 -0700

    A: add contents.md"

# Use that hash to use `cat-file`
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git cat-file -p 2eba3e1
"tree 5b21d4f16a4b07a6cde5a3242187f6a5a68b060f
author Sara <cattelia@gmail.com> 1718350377 -0700
committer Sara <cattelia@gmail.com> 1718350377 -0700

A: add contents.md"

# Send test packages
All tests passed! üéâ
```

# TREES AND BLOBS

Now that we understand some of our plumbing equipment, let's get into the pipes. Here are some terms to know:

- `tree`: git's way of storing a directory
- `blob`: git's way of storing a file

Here's what I got when I inspected my last commit:

```bash
> git cat-file -p 2eba3e1

tree 5b21d4f16a4b07a6cde5a3242187f6a5a68b060f           # TREE
author Sara <cattelia@gmail.com> 1718350377 -0700       # AUTHOR
committer Sara <cattelia@gmail.com> 1718350377 -0700    # COMMITTER

A: add contents.md                                      # COMMIT MESSAGE
```

Notice that we can see:

- The `tree` object
- The `author`
- The `committer`
- The commit message

However, we _cannot_ see the contents of the `contents.md` file itself! That's because the `tree` object stores it. Let's get that information:

```bash
# `cat-file` the Tree
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git cat-file -p 5b21d4f
100644 blob ef7e93fc61a91deecaa551c4707e4c3049af42c9    contents.md

# `cat-file` the Blob
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git cat-file -p ef7e93f
# contents

# Send test packages
All tests passed! üéâ
```

# SECOND COMMIT

Reminder of commands:

- `git log` (`q` to exit, arrow keys to scroll)
- `git cat-file -p <hash>`

### Note:

_`log` is a porcelain command, while `cat-file` is a plumbing command. You'll use `log` much more often when working on coding projects, but `cat-file` is useful for understanding Git's internals._

1. Create a second file called `titles.md` and add text.
2. Save, stage, and commit the file with any comment as long as it starts with, `B:`
3. Use `git cat-file -p` to inspect the commit I made _Notice one extra field in the commit object that wasn't present in the first commit._
4. Run test packages

```bash
# Make the new `titles.md` file
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ nano titles.md
"# Titles

* A River Runs Through It
* Fight Club
* 12 Years a Slave
* The Big Short
* 12 Monkeys"

# Check to make sure it stuck
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ lsd

# STORING DATA

Git stores an entire _snapshot_ of files on a per-commit level. This was a surprise to me! I always assumed each commit only stored the changes made in that commit.

## OPTIMIZATION

While it's true that Git stores entire snapshots, it does have some performance optimizations so that your `.git` directory doesn't get too unbearably large.

- Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles">compresses and packs files</a> to store them more efficiently.
- Git deduplicates files that are the same across different commits. If a file doesn't change between commits, Git will only store it once.

1. Use `git cat-file -p` to view the hash of the `blob` for the `titles.md` file in your last commit. Save that hash somewhere in your notes.
2. Add a new directory to your project called `quotes`. Inside, add two files:

`starwars.md`:

```
* "May the Force be with you"
* "I find your lack of faith disturbing"
* "I am your father"
* "Do or do not. There is no try"
* "I‚Äôve got a bad feeling about this"
```

`dune.md`:

```
* "May the Force be with you"
* "I find your lack of faith disturbing"
* "I am your father"
* "Do or do not. There is no try"
* "I‚Äôve got a bad feeling about this"
```

3. Stage and commit both files in a single commit with a message starting with `C:`, for example, `C: add quotes.`
4. Use the command `cat-file` to view the hash of the blob for the `titles.md` file again in the latest commit. You should notice that it still has the same hash because _the file hasn't changed_.
5. Run and submit the CLI tests.

### TIP

_You can stage each file separately:_

```bash
git add quotes/starwars.md
git add quotes/dune.md
```

_Or you can stage all the changes in your repo at once:_

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
