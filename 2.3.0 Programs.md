# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Learning PROGRAMS & EXECUTABLES</strong></span>

# COMPILED VS INTERPRETED

A program is just a set of instructions that a computer can execute. The words "program" and "executable" are often used interchangeably. Broadly speaking, there are two types of programs:

- Compiled programs
- Interpreted programs

## Compiled Programs

A compiled program is a program that has been converted from human-readable source code into machine code (binary).

## Interpretted Program

An interpreted program is a program that is executed by _another_ program. The program that executes the interpreted program is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_%28computing%29">interpreter</a>. The interpreter reads the source code of the interpreted program and executes it.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: UNDERSTANDING PROGRAMS</strong></span>

- `which` tells the location of an installed command line program
- A `sh` program is a compiled executable, probably in 'C' programming language
- `.sh` extension is a shell script. A text file that contains commands that will be interpretted and run by the `sh` program.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/worldbanc$ which sh
/usr/bin/sh

# What happens when we try to `cat` into sh?
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/worldbanc$ cat /usr/bin/sh

```

# SHEBANG

You can run any executable file by typing its file path into your shell.

```bash
bin/genids.sh
```

That works out-of-the-box for files that are compiled executables but what about programs that need an interpretter?

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">"shebang"</a> is a special line at the top of a script that tells your shell which program to use to execute the file.

## This is where SHEBANG comes in:

Shebang format:

```bash
#! interpreter [optional-arg]
```

For example, I have seen Python script shebangs in the past where I wanted a file to use `Python3`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/python3
```

This tells the system to use Python 3 located at /usr/bin/python3 to run the script.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: PRACTICE `SHEBANG`</strong></span>

Grab the SHEBANG from `private/bin/genids.sh`

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/worldbanc$ cat private/bin/genids.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

generate_fake_id() {
    counter=$1
    echo -n "ID-"
    echo "fixed_seed_$counter" \
        | cksum \
        | cut -d ' ' -f 1
}

for i in $(seq 1 12); do
    generate_fake_id $i
done
```

# BOURNE SHELL

Remember when we talked about the different shell REPLs depending on OS?

- Ubuntu on WSL -> `bash`
- macOS -> `Zzh`
- Linux -> "I pray you already know what you are doing" - Lane, Boot.dev

Here are the differences:

- `sh` - The Bourne Shell. Original Unix shell and is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX-compliant</a>.
- `bash` - The Bourne Shell again. This is the most popular shell on Linux. Builds on `sh` but also has other features.
- `zzh` - The Z shell. This is the most popular for Mac Users.

# SHELL CONFIGURATION

Bash and Zsh both have "configuration" files that run automatically each time you start a new shell session. These files are used to set up your shell environment. These files are hidden in the `~` home directory.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ ls -a ~
.bashrc        .landscape
.npm           .sqlite_history
.wget-hsts      go
.cache         .local
.profile       .sudo_as_admin_successful
.wsl-config     worldbanc
.bash_history  .config
.motd_shown    .pyenv
.viminfo        Downloads
worldbanc.zip
.bash_logout   .gitconfig
.node_repl_history
.python_history
.vscode-server  github
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: PRACTICE CONFIGURING SHELL</strong></span>

Getting into the config file and add `Hello from the shell~!`.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ nano ~/.bashrc
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples

# If not running interactively, don't do anything
case $- in
    *i*) ;;
      *) return;;
esac
.
.
.
echo "Hello from the shell~!"
```

Reboot the terminal and open a new one. I should see my addition.

```bash
Hello from the shell~!
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$
```

# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Environment Variables are available to _all_ programs that you run in your shell. You can view all of the environment variables that are currently set in your shell with the command `env`.

To set a variable in your shell, you can use `export` command. The interesting part is that programs and scripts you run in your shell can also use that variable. Create a new `sh` script named `introduce.sh`, make it an executable, and then run on `WSL`.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ export NAME="Sara"
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ echo $NAME
Sara
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ nano
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hi I'm $NAME"
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ ls
Downloads  github  go  introduce.sh  worldbanc  worldbanc.zip
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ chmod +x ./introduce.sh
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ ./introduce.sh
Hi I'm Sara
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: PRACTICE ENV VARIABLES</strong></span>

Take a look at the contents of the `warn.sh` script in the `worldbanc/private/bin` directory. `export` the required environment variables:

- `WARN MESSAGE` : "The auditor is here"
- `WARN_FROM_NAME`: "Your worst nightmare"

### TIP

// You can also temporarily set a variable for a single command, instead of exporting it (exporting means the variable will persist until you close the shell). Example: `WARN_MESSAGE="this works too" ./warn.sh`

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ cd worldbanc/private/bin/
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/worldbanc/private/bin$ ls
genids.sh  malicious.sh  process_transactions.sh  warn.sh  worldbanc.sh
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/worldbanc/private/bin$ WARN_FROM_NAME="Your worst nightmare" WARN_MESSAGE="The auditor is here" ./warn.sh

============================================
=========== WORLDBANC WARNING ==============
============================================
The auditor is here
============================================
From: Your worst nightmare
============================================

# With the temporary option, notice that I had to set all variables at the same time.
# [variable_1="" ... variable_n="" ./script.sh]
```

# PATH

_**This is one of the most important lessons in this entire course!**_

There are environment variables that are sort of "built-in" to your shell. By "built-in" I just mean that different programs and parts of your system know about them and use them. The `PATH` variable is one of those.

## Why do we care about `PATH`?

If it weren't for the `PATH`, you'd have to remember the filesystem path of every executable you wanted to run.

## Whats's in teh `PATH` variable?

Take a look at your current PATH variable. There is a giant list of directories that are separated by, `:`

```bash
echo $PATH
/home/cattelia/.local/bin:/home/ ...
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: PRACTICE `PATH`</strong></span>

Temporarily disable `PATH` variable so I can run executable using the full path. Reset the `PATH`.

### NOTE

// _This will only affect your current shell session. If you open a new shell, it will have the default `PATH` variable again._

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ export PATH=""
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ ls
-bash: ls: No such file or directory
```

# CHANGE YOUR PATH

A common problem you'll run into in the future is that you install a new program on your machine, but when you try to run it from your terminal, you get an error like, "command cannot be found". Nine times out of ten, this is because the program is installed in a location that's not in your `PATH` variable.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: PRACTICE UPDATING `PATH`</strong></span>

Add the `worldbanc/private/bin` directory to your `PATH` variable.

Example: `export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/new"`

- `$PATH` - reference to the existing `PATH` variable
- `:` - separates the existing directories to the one I am adding in `/path/to/new`

Once complete, `cd ~` to the home directory and run `worldbanc.sh`

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ export PATH="$PATH:worldbanc/private/bin"
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ echo $PATH
/home/cattelia/.local/bin:/home ... /Nmap:/snap/bin:"worldbanc/private/bin"
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ cd ~
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ worldbanc.sh

# PATH CONFIG

While our earlier efforts have been changing file paths, the trouble is, everytime I restart my shell, it will be reset to its default state. You have to make _permanent_ changes, which we can do by the `export` command.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: PRACTICE UPDATING `PATH`</strong></span>

Edit my `.bashrc` file and add an export command to the end of the file that adds the worldbanc/private/bin directory to your PATH variable. Then restart the shell.

```bash
Hello from the shell~!
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ nano ~/.bashrc
# Rebooted
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ worldbanc.sh
Welcome to the worldbanc CLI tool!
Please enter your name:

# MAN

The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=m-man-command">man</a> command is short for "manual". It's a program that displays the manual for other programs.

## Opening `MAN`

The `man` command will only work for programs that it has a manual for, but most built-in commands and Unix programs are supported.

```bash
# open the man pages for the 'man' command
man man
```

## Searching `MAN`

More often then not, the manual is usually a reference to quick look ups or special flags.

- `/[text]` - search for text, then press `Enter`
- `n` - to go to the next instance found
- `N` - to go back to the previous instance found
- `q` - to quit
- `h` - for help screen
- `spacebar` - to move through manual

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ man ls
/-r # Search for "-r" flag
"DESCRIPTION
...skipping...
       -h, --human-readable"
n # Go to next instance
"...skipping...
       -r, --reverse
              reverse order while"
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: PRACTICE `MAN`</strong></span>

We want to get used to `grep` as it will be our best friend in the coming future and long after that. Open the `man` to `grep` and read the first few lines to get a handle on what it is about. Then answer questions.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ man grep
"GREP(1)
NAME
       grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep - print lines that match patterns
SYNOPSIS...
"
# Question 1: What does `-v` do?
/-v
"-v, --invert-match
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines."
# Question 2: Which option is incorrect?: -t, -r, -i, -c
/-t
q
```

# FLAGS

Some commands take <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=names-command-flags">flags</a>. Flags are options you can pass to a command to change its behavior. We've seen this with `ls` and adding `-l` for vertical listing and showing respective user controls and `-a` to list all.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ ls
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ ls -l
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ ls -la
```

## Conventions of Flags

There is really no "standard" as the flags behave based on the developer of said command. HOwever, there are some common conventions"

- Single-character flags are prefixed with a single dash (.e.g `-a`)
- Multi-character flags are prefixed with two dashes (e.g. `--help`)
- Sometimes the same flag can be used with a single dash or two dashes (e.g. `-h` or `--help`)

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: PRACTICE FLAGS</strong></span>

Some files in `worldbanc` have been messed with. Figure out which one it is. Paste the number of bytes.

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~$ cd worldbanc/public/
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/worldbanc/public$ ls
company_info.md  key.txt  pr_ideas.txt  products
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/worldbanc/public$ man wc
/-c
"       -c, --bytes
              print the byte counts"
q
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/worldbanc/public$ wc -c pr_ideas.txt
1098 pr_ideas.txt
```

### NOTE

// _Use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=af-counting-words-lines-bytes-in-files-wc-command">"word count" command</a>, `wc`, to count the number of bytes in the `worldbanc/public/pr_ideas.txt`._

# POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

Programming languages have functions, and functions take arguments. This python function for example:

```python
def print_player(xp, level):
    print("Player has", xp, "xp and is level", level)

print_player(100, 2)
# Player has 100 xp and is level 2
```

The same if true for shell.
