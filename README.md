## At the beginning and end of each section you will see:

### _<div align="center"> "All <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span> work done by <span style="color:#ECAD35">Sara Eilenstine</span>.

`All of the solutions and projects will have been solved and curated by my own learning of the Boot.dev material, FreeCodeCamp or through my CS degree. As well as other subsidiary material found amoung the internets. I make a huge effort in adding resources that were instrumental to solving problems that were from outside of Boot.dev.`

`All of the questions, reading material, quizzes, pictures and Output files are curated by Boot.dev and their team. Including the photos you see in this Readme.md file.`

### **Key to Text Color**

While I wanted the colors to be cohesive to the general feel of the Markdown file and the media of Boot.dev, the colors also mean something.

| Pantone                                        |                      Color                       |                   Party Represented                    |

## File Name such as: `worldbanc` or `webflyx` and so on...

These files are the curated study material that Boot.dev had me work through to learn the basics and fundamentals of the languages or concepts that I was working on. They are located in the file that they were meant to be used for.
