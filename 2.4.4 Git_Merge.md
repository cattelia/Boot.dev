# MERGE

"What's the point of having multiple branches?" you might ask. They're most often used to safely make changes without affecting your (or your team's) primary branch. However, once you're happy with your changes, you'll want to <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge">merge</a> them back into the main branch so that they make their way into the final product.

# VISUAL MERGE

Let's say you're in a state where you have two branches, each with their own unique commits:

```bash
A - B - C    main
   \
    D - E    other_branch
```

If you merge `other_branch` into `main`, Git combines both branches by creating a new commit that has both histories as parents. In the diagram below, `F` is a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_true_merge">merge commit</a> that has `C` and `E` as parents. `F` brings all the changes from `D` and `E` back into the main branch.

```bash
A - B - C - F    main
   \     /
    D - E        other_branch
```

### Try it myself

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git switch main
Already on 'main'
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ cat contents.md
# contents
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ nano contents.md
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ cat contents.md
# contents

"* titles.md: The movie titles in the WebFlyx collection
* classics.csv: A comma-separated list of classic movies
* quotes: A directory of files containing memorable quotes from movies"

cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git add ./contents.md
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   contents.md

cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git commit -m "E: update contents.md"
[main aa9c7dd] E: update contents.md
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
```

My merge commit history should look something like this now:

```bash
A - B - C - E    main
         \
           D     add_classics
```

Run graph command to see this in action:

```bash
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git log --oneline --graph --all
* aa9c7dd (HEAD -> main) E: update contents.md
| * 2df649c (add_classics) D: add classics.csv
|/
* f3a8dab C: add quotes
* f576ca1 B: add titles
* 2eba3e1 A: add contents.md

# MERGE COMMITS

A merge commit is the result of merging two branches together.

Let's say we start with:

```bash
A - B - C    main
   \
    D - E    vimchadsonly
```

And we merge vimchadsonly into main by running this while on main:

```bash
git merge vimchadsonly
```

The merge will:

1. Find the "merge base" commit, or "best common ancestor" of the two branches. In this case, "A".
2. Replays the changes from `vimchadsonly` onto `main` starting from the best common ancestor.
3. Records the result as a new commit, in our case "F".
4. "F" is special because it has two parents, "C" and "E".

**After**:

```bash
A - B - C - F    main
   \     /
    D - E        vimchadsonly
```

### Try it myself:

1. Let's get the changes from the `add_classics` branch merged into the `main` branch. You will be presented with a code editor to change the commit message.
2. Update the message to start with `F:`. Aside from that, use the default message. E.g. `F: Merge branch 'add_classics'`.
   _Save the file, and close the editor. See the tips below if you don't know how to exit the editor._
3. Finally, still from the main branch run `git log --oneline --decorate --graph --parents` _This should give you a nice visual representation of the merge commit._

```bash
# Confirm we are on the main branch
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git branch
  add_classics
* main
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git merge add_classics
Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.
 classics.csv | 6 ++++++
 1 file changed, 6 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 classics.csv
# F: Merge branch 'add_classics'

# Let's see the graph representation of this merge now
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git log --oneline --decorate --graph --parents
*   39b9349 aa9c7dd 2df649c (HEAD -> main) F: Merge branch 'add_classics'
|\
| * 2df649c f3a8dab (add_classics) D: add classics.csv
* | aa9c7dd f3a8dab E: update contents.md
|/
* f3a8dab f576ca1 C: add quotes
* f576ca1 2eba3e1 B: add titles
* 2eba3e1 A: add contents.md

# Send test packages
All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

### TIPS

// _Remember, if you mess up a commit message, you can change it with the --amend flag. For example:_

```bash
git commit --amend -m "F: Merge branch 'add_classics'"
```

// _To save and exit the editor:_

- _If Nano was opened, press `ctrl+x`, then `y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save._
- _If Vim was opened, press `esc`, then `:` to enter command mode, then `wq` to write and quit._
- _If VSCode was opened, press `ctrl+s` or `cmd+s` to save, then click the `x` button to close._

# MERGE LOG

Your output from `git log --oneline --decorate --graph --parents` (aside from the hashes) should look something like:

```bash
*   89629a9 d234104 b8dfd64 (HEAD -> main) F: Merge branch 'add_classics'
|\
| * b8dfd64 fba0999 (tag: 5.8, add_classics) D: add classics
* | d234104 fba0999 (tag: 6.1) E: update contents
|/
* fba0999 1381199 (tag: 3.8, origin/master, origin/main, master) C: add quotes
* 1381199 a21228f (tag: 3.7) B: add titles.md
* a21228f A: add contents.md
```

Each asterisk `*` represents a commit in the repository. There are multiple commit hashes on each line because the `--parents` flag logs the parent hash(es) as well.

- The first line, with these three hashes: `89629a9 d234104 b8dfd64` is our recent merge commit. The first hash, `89629a9` is the merge commit's hash, and the other two are the parent commits.
- The next section is a visual representation of the branch structure. It shows the commits on the `add_classics` branch and the `main` branch before the merge. Notice that they both share a common parent.
- The next three lines are just "normal" commits, each pointing to their parent.
- The last line is the initial commit and therefore has no parent.

### Let's answer questions on what we learned:

```bash
# Why does the first line show 3 commit hashes?
Because its a merge commit. It shows its own hash with the 2 other parent nodes.

# Why the weird diagram, e.g., |\', '| *', '* |', and '|/'?
Its demonstrating that add_classics was merged into main
```

# FAST FORWARD MERGE

The simplest type of merge is a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_fast_forward_merge">fast-forward merge</a>. Let's say we start with this:

```bash
      C     delete_vscode
     /
A - B       main
```

And we run this while on main:

```bash
git merge delete_vscode
```

Because `delete_vscode` has all the commits that `main` has, Git automatically does a fast-forward merge. It just moves the pointer of the "base" branch to the tip of the "feature" branch:

```bash
            other_branch
A - B - C   main
```

Notice that with a fast-forward merge, no <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_true_merge">merge commit</a> is created.

This is a common workflow when working with Git on a team of developers:

1. Create a branch for a new change
2. Make the change
3. Merge the branch back into `main` (or whatever branch your team dubs the "default" branch)
4. Remove the branch
5. Repeat

### Try it myself

Because the `add_classics` branch has been merged into main, we don't need it anymore.

1. Delete the `add_classics` branch.
2. Create a new branch off `main` called `update_titles`. You can use <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch#Documentation/git-switch.txt--cltnew-branchgt">git switch -c</a>.
3. Add a commit to that branch that updates the `titles.md` file and add "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" as the final entry in the list of movies. Use `G:` to prefix the commit message.
4. Run g`it log --oneline` to make sure the commit is there.
5. Run and submit the CLI tests from the `update_titles` branch.

```bash
# Notice how `add_classics` still exists.
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git branch
  add_classics
* main
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git branch -d add_classics
"Deleted branch add_classics (was 2df649c)."
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git branch
* main
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git switch -c update_titles
"Switched to a new branch 'update_titles'"
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git branch
  main
* update_titles
# Update titles.md with new input
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ nano titles.md
# Stage it to be committed
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git add ./titles.md
# Check that it is there
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git status
On branch update_titles
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   titles.md
# Commit the new titles.
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git commit -m "G: add titles"
[update_titles ef237e8] G: add titles
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
# Check git log history
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git log --oneline
ef237e8 (HEAD -> update_titles) G: add titles
39b9349 (main) F: Merge branch 'add_classics'
aa9c7dd E: update contents.md
2df649c D: add classics.csv
f3a8dab C: add quotes
f576ca1 B: add titles
2eba3e1 A: add contents.md

# Send test packages
All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

**Next, we are going to merge this back into main**

```bash
# Switch back to main and notice that there is no `G:` commit
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git switch main
Switched to branch 'main'
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git log --oneline
39b9349 (HEAD -> main) F: Merge branch 'add_classics'
aa9c7dd E: update contents.md
2df649c D: add classics.csv
f3a8dab C: add quotes
f576ca1 B: add titles
2eba3e1 A: add contents.md

# Merge here
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git merge update_titles
Updating 39b9349..ef237e8
Fast-forward
 titles.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 # You can now see `G:` in the git log
cattelia@Amaterasu:~/webflyx$ git log --oneline
ef237e8 (HEAD -> main, update_titles) G: add titles
39b9349 F: Merge branch 'add_classics'
aa9c7dd E: update contents.md
2df649c D: add classics.csv
f3a8dab C: add quotes
f576ca1 B: add titles
2eba3e1 A: add contents.md

# Send test packages
All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```
