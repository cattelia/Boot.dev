# What is Currying?

Function <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">currying</a> is a specific kind of function transformation where we translate a single function that accepts multiple arguments into multiple functions that each accept a single argument.

This is a "normal" 3-argument function:

```python
box_volume(3, 4, 5)
```

This is a "curried" series of functions that does the same thing:

```python
box_volume(3)(4)(5)
```

Here's another example that includes the implementations:

```python
def sum(a, b):
  return a + b

print(sum(1, 2))
# prints 3
```

And the same thing curried:

```python
def sum(a):
  def inner_sum(b):
    return a + b
  return inner_sum

print(sum(1)(2))
# prints 3
```

The `sum` function only takes a single input, `a`. It returns a new function that takes a single input, `b`. This new function when called with `a` value for `b` will return the `sum` of `a` and `b`. We'll talk later about why this is useful.

Fix the `converted_font_size` function. We are using a 3rd party code library that expects our function to be a curried series of functions that each take a single argument.

- `converted_font_size` should just take a single argument, `font_size` and return a function that takes a single argument, `doc_type`.
- That function should return the `font_size` multiplied by the appropriate value for the given `doc_type`.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
# What was originally given

def converted_font_size(font_size, doc_type):
    if doc_type == "txt":
        return font_size
    if doc_type == "md":
        return font_size * 2
    if doc_type == "docx":
        return font_size * 3
    raise ValueError("Invalid doc type")
```

```python
def converted_font_size(font_size):

    def change_font(doc_type):
        if doc_type == "txt":
            return font_size
        if doc_type == "md":
            return font_size * 2
        if doc_type == "docx":
            return font_size * 3
        raise ValueError("Invalid doc type")

    return change_font
```

# WHY CURRY?

It's fairly obvious that:

```python
def sum(a, b):
  return a + b
```

is simpler than:

```python
def sum(a):
  def inner_sum(b):
    return a + b
  return inner_sum
```

So why would we ever want to do the more complicated thing? Well, currying is often used to change a function's signature to make it conform to a specific shape. For example:

```python
def colorize(converter, doc):
  # ...
  converter(doc)
  # ...
```

The `colorize` function accepts a function called `converter` as input, and at some point during its execution, it calls `converter` with a single argument. That means that it expects `converter` to accept exactly one argument. So, if I have a conversion function like this:

```python
def markdown_to_html(doc, asterisk_style):
  # ...
```

I can't use it with `colorize` because it wants two arguments. To solve this problem, I can curry `markdown_to_html` into a function that takes a single argument:

```python
def markdown_to_html(asterisk_style):
  def asterisk_md_to_html(doc):
    # do stuff with doc and asterisk_style...

  return asterisk_md_to_html

markdown_to_html_italic = markdown_to_html('italic')
colorize(markdown_to_html_italic, doc)
```
