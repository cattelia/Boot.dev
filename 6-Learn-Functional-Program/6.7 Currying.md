# What is Currying?

Function <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">currying</a> is a specific kind of function transformation where we translate a single function that accepts multiple arguments into multiple functions that each accept a single argument.

This is a "normal" 3-argument function:

```python
box_volume(3, 4, 5)
```

This is a "curried" series of functions that does the same thing:

```python
box_volume(3)(4)(5)
```

Here's another example that includes the implementations:

```python
def sum(a, b):
  return a + b

print(sum(1, 2))
# prints 3
```

And the same thing curried:

```python
def sum(a):
  def inner_sum(b):
    return a + b
  return inner_sum

print(sum(1)(2))
# prints 3
```

The `sum` function only takes a single input, `a`. It returns a new function that takes a single input, `b`. This new function when called with `a` value for `b` will return the `sum` of `a` and `b`. We'll talk later about why this is useful.

Fix the `converted_font_size` function. We are using a 3rd party code library that expects our function to be a curried series of functions that each take a single argument.

- `converted_font_size` should just take a single argument, `font_size` and return a function that takes a single argument, `doc_type`.
- That function should return the `font_size` multiplied by the appropriate value for the given `doc_type`.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
# What was originally given

def converted_font_size(font_size, doc_type):
    if doc_type == "txt":
        return font_size
    if doc_type == "md":
        return font_size * 2
    if doc_type == "docx":
        return font_size * 3
    raise ValueError("Invalid doc type")
```

```python
# What the solution is

def converted_font_size(font_size):

    def change_font(doc_type):
        if doc_type == "txt":
            return font_size
        if doc_type == "md":
            return font_size * 2
        if doc_type == "docx":
            return font_size * 3
        raise ValueError("Invalid doc type")

    return change_font
```

# WHY CURRY?

It's fairly obvious that:

```python
def sum(a, b):
  return a + b
```

is simpler than:

```python
def sum(a):
  def inner_sum(b):
    return a + b
  return inner_sum
```

So why would we ever want to do the more complicated thing? Well, currying is often used to change a function's signature to make it conform to a specific shape. For example:

```python
def colorize(converter, doc):
  # ...
  converter(doc)
  # ...
```

The `colorize` function accepts a function called `converter` as input, and at some point during its execution, it calls `converter` with a single argument. That means that it expects `converter` to accept exactly one argument. So, if I have a conversion function like this:

```python
def markdown_to_html(doc, asterisk_style):
  # ...
```

I can't use it with `colorize` because it wants two arguments. To solve this problem, I can curry `markdown_to_html` into a function that takes a single argument:

```python
def markdown_to_html(asterisk_style):
  def asterisk_md_to_html(doc):
    # do stuff with doc and asterisk_style...

  return asterisk_md_to_html

markdown_to_html_italic = markdown_to_html('italic')
colorize(markdown_to_html_italic, doc)
```

# Review

Remember, currying is when we take a function that accepts multiple arguments:

```python
final_volume = box_volume(3, 4, 5)
print(final_volume)
# 60
```

And convert it into a series of functions that each accept a single argument:

```python
final_volume = box_volume(3)(4)(5)
print(final_volume)
# 60
```

- `box_volume(3)` returns a new function that accepts a single integer and returns a new function
- `box_volume(3)(4)` returns another new function that accepts a single integer and returns a new function
- `box_volume(3)(4)(5)` returns the final result

Here's another way of calling it, where each function is stored in a variable before being called:

```python
with_length_3 = box_volume(3)
with_len_3_width_4 = with_length_3(4)
final_volume = with_len_3_width_4(5)
print(final_volume)
# 60
```

Here are the function definitions:

```python
def box_volume(length):
  def box_volume_with_len(width):
    def box_volume_with_len_width(height):
      return length * width * height
    return box_volume_with_len_width
  return box_volume_with_len
```

Doc2Doc needs to be able to find the number of lines in a document that contain a specific sequence of characters. For example, given the following document:

```python
aaaa
bbbb
ccdd
aabb
```

How many lines contain the sequence "aa"? The answer is 2: "aaaa" and "aabb".

Complete the `lines_with_sequence` function. It should return a series of curried functions so it can be called like this:

```python
num_lines = lines_with_sequence(char)(length)(doc)
```

The "sequence" is generated by the first `with_char` that has been provided for you. It works like this:

| Character | Length | Sequence   |
| --------- | ------ | ---------- |
| "a"       | 3      | "aaa"      |
| "b"       | 2      | "bb"       |
| "\*"      | 4      | "\*\*\*\*" |

You need to define and return a second curried function. I called mine `with_length`. It should accept the final parameter, a `doc` string, and return the number of lines that contain the sequence.

1. Define the `with_length` function inside the `with_char` function, it should accept a doc.
2. Split the `doc` into lines.
3. Use a loop (or if you're feeling fancy, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce">reduce</a>) to count the number of lines that contain the sequence in them.
4. Return the count from the `with_length` function.
5. Return the `with_length` function from the `with_char` function.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def lines_with_sequence(char):

    def with_char(length):
        sequence = char * length

        def with_length(doc):
            count = 0
            print(doc.split())
            for i in doc.split():
                if sequence in i:
                    count += 1
            return count

        return with_length

    return with_char
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: HTML Table</strong></span>

## HTML TABLE

Doc2Doc should have tools to create HTML boilerplate. One of the features should create a table. An HTML table has a header row and data rows. A header row has headers for the columns. Each normal row has data cells which contain the information in the table. It is essentially a 2-dimensional list.

Example HTML Table:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Row 1, Header 1</th>
    <th>Row 1, Header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2, Cell 1</td>
    <td>Row 2, Cell 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 3, Cell 1</td>
    <td>Row 3, Cell 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

**Result:**

| Row 1, Header 1 | Row 1, Header 2 |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
|  Row 2, Cell 1  |  Row 2, Cell 2  |
|  Row 3, Cell 1  |  Row 3, Cell 2  |

Complete the `create_html_table` function. It takes a list of lists of strings, `data_rows`, and returns a function, `create_table_headers`. `create_table_headers` should take a list of strings, `headers`, and convert them into the header row of the table, then return the complete HTML table as a string without any added whitespace or indentation. Use the provided `create_tagger` function to format the html tags around the content of the `data_rows` and `headers`.

1. Use the provided functions to complete the `create_html_table` function:

- `"td"`: Each item in a table goes in its own data cell, which are arranged in rows.
- `"tr"`: The table row tag goes around each row of cells.
- `"th"`: The header cells hold the headers for each column and belong in the first row.
- `"table"`: This is the parent tag of the entire table.

2. Try to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce">`reduce` function of the `functools` module</a> to convert the `data_rows` into rows. You can nest the `reduce` function with lambdas to handle the nested list, or you may use loops instead.

- For each list in the `data_rows`, convert the items in the list into data cells within a table row.
- Add the table rows together as a single string.

3. Within the `create_table_headers` function:

- Tag the strings in the `headers` list as header cells in a table row.
- Add the row of headers as the first row.
- Add the final tag, `"table"`, around all of the rows and return one single string containing the HTML table.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
from functools import reduce


def create_tagger(tag):
    def tagger(content):
        return f"<{tag}>{content}</{tag}>"

    return tagger


def create_accumulator(tagger):
    def accumulate(items):
        return reduce(lambda acc, item: acc + tagger(item), items, "")

    return accumulate


tag_data = create_tagger("td")
tag_header = create_tagger("th")
tag_row = create_tagger("tr")
tag_table = create_tagger("table")

accumulate_data = create_accumulator(tag_data)
accumulate_row = create_accumulator(tag_row)
accumulate_header = create_accumulator(tag_header)


# don't touch above this line


def create_html_table(data_rows):
    rows = accumulate_row(map(accumulate_data, data_rows))

    def create_table_headers(headers):
        nonlocal rows
        header_row = tag_row(accumulate_header(headers))
        rows = header_row + rows
        table = tag_table(rows)
        return table

    return create_table_headers
```
