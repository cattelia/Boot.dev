# WHAT IS FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING?

Functional programming is a style (or "paradigm" if you're pretentious) of programming where we compose functions instead of mutating state (updating the value of variables).

- Functional programming is more about declaring what you want to happen, rather than how you want it to happen.
- Imperative (or procedural) programming declares both the what and the how.

### Example of imperative code:

```python
car = create_car()
car.add_gas(10)
car.clean_windows()
```

### Example of functional code:

```python
return clean_windows(add_gas(create_car()))
```

The important distinction is that in the functional example, we never change the value of the `car` variable, we just compose functions that return new values, with the outermost function, `clean_windows` in this case, returning the final result.

## DOC2DOC

In this course, we're working on "Doc2Doc", a command line tool for converting documents from one format to another. If you're familiar with Pandoc, the idea is similar.

Complete the `stylize_title` function. It should take a single string as input, and return a single string as output. The returned string should have both the title centered and a border added.

- Use the provided functions `center_title` and `add_border`.
- Center the title before adding the border.
- Do not create any variables.
- Use only 1 line of code in the function body.

```python
def stylize_title(document):
    #
    return add_border(center_title(document))


# Don't touch below this line


def center_title(document):
    width = 40
    title = document.split("\n")[0]
    centered_title = title.center(width)
    return document.replace(title, centered_title)


def add_border(document):
    title = document.split("\n")[0]
    border = "*" * len(title)
    return document.replace(title, title + "\n" + border)
```

# FUNCTIONAL VS OOP

Functional programming and object-oriented programming are styles for writing code. One isn't inherently superior to the other, but to be a well-rounded developer you should understand both well and use ideas from each when appropriate.

You'll encounter developers who love functional programming and others who love object-oriented programming. However, contrary to popular opinion, FP and OOP are _not_ always at odds with one another. They aren't opposites. Of the four pillars of OOP, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)">inheritance</a> is the only one that doesn't fit with functional programming.

Inheritance isn't seen in functional code due to the mutable classes that come along with it. Encapsulation, polymorphism and abstraction are still used all the time in functional programming.

When working in a language that supports ideas from both FP and OOP (like Python, JavaScript, or Go) the best developers are the ones who can use the best ideas from both paradigms effectively and appropriately.

# IMMUTABILITY

In FP, we strive to make data _**immutable**_. Once a value is created, it cannot be changed. _Mutable_ data, on the other hand, can be changed after it's created.

### _Why would I care?_

When a variable is immutable, you can be sure that it hasn't changed since it was created. It's a helluva lot easier to work with.

Generally speaking, immutability means fewer bugs and more maintainable code.

## TUPLES VS LISTS

Tuples and lists are both ordered collections of values, but tuples are immutable and lists are mutable.

You can append to a list, but you can not append to a tuple. You can create a new copy of a tuple using values from an existing tuple, but you can't change the existing tuple.

### LIST ARE MUTABLE

```python
ages = [16, 21, 30]
# 'ages' is being changed in place
ages.append(80)
# [16, 21, 30, 80]
```

### TUPLES ARE IMMUTABLE

```python
ages = (16, 21, 30)
more_ages = (80,) # note the comma! It's required for a single-element tuple
# 'all_ages' is a brand new tuple
all_ages = ages + more_ages
# (16, 21, 30, 80)
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

The add_prefix function should do 2 things:

1. Add a prefix of `X.` to the beginning of each new document, where `X` is the index of the `document` in the batch. (The first document should be `0.` , next should be `1.` , etc.)
2. Return the documents tuple with the new document added to the end.

It accepts 2 arguments:

1. "document": a string
2. "documents": the current tuple of strings

### **Run the code to see the error.**

Whoever wrote this code assumed that `documents` is a list, but it's a tuple!

```python
def add_prefix(document, documents):
    prefix = f"{len(documents)}. "
    new_doc = prefix + document
    documents.append(new_doc)
    return documents
```

### Error:

```python
---------------------------------
Inputs:
 * document: ('hello there', 'sonny', 'how ya doing')
Expecting: ('0. hello there', '1. sonny', '2. how ya doing')
Actual: Error: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'
Fail
============= FAIL ==============
0 passed, 1 failed
```

**Fix the bug.** Instead of attempting to mutate the input tuple, create a brand new tuple with the new document added to the end and return that.

```python

```
