# WHAT IS FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING?

Functional programming is a style (or "paradigm" if you're pretentious) of programming where we compose functions instead of mutating state (updating the value of variables).

- Functional programming is more about declaring what you want to happen, rather than how you want it to happen.
- Imperative (or procedural) programming declares both the what and the how.

### Example of imperative code:

```python
car = create_car()
car.add_gas(10)
car.clean_windows()
```

### Example of functional code:

```python
return clean_windows(add_gas(create_car()))
```

The important distinction is that in the functional example, we never change the value of the `car` variable, we just compose functions that return new values, with the outermost function, `clean_windows` in this case, returning the final result.

## DOC2DOC

In this course, we're working on "Doc2Doc", a command line tool for converting documents from one format to another. If you're familiar with Pandoc, the idea is similar.

Complete the `stylize_title` function. It should take a single string as input, and return a single string as output. The returned string should have both the title centered and a border added.

- Use the provided functions `center_title` and `add_border`.
- Center the title before adding the border.
- Do not create any variables.
- Use only 1 line of code in the function body.

```python
def stylize_title(document):
    pass


# Don't touch below this line


def center_title(document):
    width = 40
    title = document.split("\n")[0]
    centered_title = title.center(width)
    return document.replace(title, centered_title)


def add_border(document):
    title = document.split("\n")[0]
    border = "*" * len(title)
    return document.replace(title, title + "\n" + border)
```
