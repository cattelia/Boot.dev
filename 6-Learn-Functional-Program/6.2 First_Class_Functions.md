# FUNCTIONS AS VALUES

In Python, functions are just values, like strings, integers, or objects. For example, we can assign an existing function to a variable:

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# assign the function to a new variable
# called "addition". It behaves the same
# as the original "add" function
addition = add
print(addition(2, 5))
# 7
```

With the popularity of generative AI (like ChatGPT), we need to be able to convert files into pure text to be injected into prompts.

**Complete the `file_to_prompt` function.** It should take a `file` dictionary and a `to_string` function as inputs and return a formatted string. The provided `to_string` function is responsible for converting the file dictionary into a string: you don't need to implement it, it's a value passed to your function.

However, your function should wrap the result of the `to_string` function in triple backticks (`````) to format it as a code block in Markdown. For example:

```python
an example string
```

should become:

```python
'''
an example string
'''
```

### TIPS

// _Note the two newlines! You don't need a trailing newline, but you do need the 2 newlines between the triple backticks. You can achieve this by using the newline `\n` escape character. Here's an example:_

```python
print("I wish the ring had never come to me.\nI wish none of this had happened.")
```

becomes:

```python
I wish the ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.
```

````python
def file_to_prompt(file, to_string):
    return f"```\n{to_string(file)}\n```"

# ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS

Anonymous functions have _no name_, and in Python, they're called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda">lambda functions</a> after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>. Here's a `lambda` function that takes a single argument `x` and returns the result of `x + 1`:

```python
lambda x: x + 1
```

Notice that the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#expressions">expression</a> `x + 1` is returned _automatically_, no need for a `return` statement. And because functions are just values, we can assign the function to a variable named `add_one`:

```python
add_one = lambda x: x + 1
print(add_one(2))
# 3
```

Lambda functions might look scary, but they're still just functions. Because they simply return the result of an expression, they're often used for small, simple evaluations. Here's an example that uses a lambda to get a value from a dictionary:

```python
get_age = lambda name: {
    'lane': 29,
    'hunter': 69,
    'allan': 17
}.get(name, 'not found')
print(get_age('lane'))
# 29
```

Complete the `file_type_getter` function. This function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains:

1. A "file type" (e.g. "code", "document", "image", etc)
2. A list of associated file extensions (e.g. `['.py', '.js']` or `['.docx', '.doc']`)

First, create a dictionary that maps each file extension to its corresponding file type, based on the input tuples. For example, the resulting dictionary might be:

```python
{
    '.doc': 'text',
    '.docx': 'document',
    '.py': 'code',
    '.jpg': 'image'
}
```

Next, return a `lambda` function that accepts a string (a file extension) and returns the corresponding file type. If the extension is not found in the dictionary, the lambda function should return `"Unknown"`. I used the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get">.get</a> dictionary method to handle this.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def file_type_getter(file_extension_tuples):
    # Initialize new dictionary
    file_type_dictionary = {}

    # Get individual tuples from the list of tuples
    for file_tuple in file_extension_tuples:
        # Get the file types and their file names
        for file in file_tuple[1]:
            # And then add them to a dictionary
            file_type_dictionary[file] = file_tuple[0]

    #print(file_type_dictionary)

    return lambda ext: file_type_dictionary.get(ext, "Unknown")

    #### ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION ####
    # Initialize new dictionary
    file_type_dictionary = {}
    # Get individual file types and  list of extensions from the list of tuples
    for file_tuple, extensions in file_extension_tuples:
        # Get the individual extensions in the list of extensions
        for ext in extensions:
            # And then add them to a dictionary
            file_type_dictionary[ext] = file_tuple

    return lambda ext: file_type_dictionary.get(ext, "Unknown")
```
