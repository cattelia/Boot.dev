# What are Decorators?

<a href="https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/decorators.html">Decorators</a> are just <a href-="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntactic sugar</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">higher-order functions</a>.

**Example:**

```python
def vowel_counter(func_to_decorate):
    vowel_count = 0
    def wrapper(doc):
        nonlocal vowel_count
        vowels = "aeiou"
        for char in doc:
            if char in vowels:
                vowel_count += 1
        print(f"Vowel count: {vowel_count}")
        return func_to_decorate(doc)
    return wrapper

@vowel_counter
def process_doc(doc):
    print(f"Document: {doc}")

process_doc("What")
# Vowel count: 1
# Document: What

process_doc("a wonderful")
# Vowel count: 5
# Document: a wonderful

process_doc("world")
# Vowel count: 6
# Document: world
```

The `@vowel_counter` line is "decorating" the `process_doc` function with the `vowel_counter` function. `vowel_counter` is called once when `process_doc` is defined with the @ syntax, but the wrapper function that it returns is called every time `process_doc` is called. That's why `vowel_count` is preserved and printed after each time.

## It's just "syntactic sugar"

Decorators are just another (sometimes simpler) way of writing a higher-order function. These two pieces of code are _identical_:

### WITH DECORATOR

```python
@vowel_counter
def process_doc(doc):
    print(f"Document: {doc}")

process_doc("Something wicked this way comes")
```

### WITHOUT DECORATOR

```python
def process(doc):
    print(f"Document: {doc}")

process_doc = vowel_counter(process)
process_doc("Something wicked this way comes")
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

The provided `file_type_aggregator` function is intended to decorate other functions. It assumes that the function it decorates has exactly 2 positional arguments.

Create a `process_doc` function that's decorated by `file_type_aggregator`. It should return the following string:

```python
f"Processing doc: '{doc}'. File Type: {file_type}"
```

Where `doc` and `file_type` are its positional arguments. (See line 11 for where it's being called.)

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def file_type_aggregator(func_to_decorate):
    # dict of file_type -> count
    counts = {}

    def wrapper(doc, file_type):
        nonlocal counts

        if file_type not in counts:
            counts[file_type] = 0
        counts[file_type] += 1
        result = func_to_decorate(doc, file_type)

        return result, counts

    return wrapper


# don't touch above this line
@file_type_aggregator
def process_doc(doc, file_type):
    return f"Processing doc: '{doc}'. File Type: {file_type}"
```

# Args and kwargs

In Python, `*args` and `**kwargs` allow a function to accept and deal with a variable number of arguments.

- `*args` collects positional arguments into a tuple
- `**kwargs` collects keyword (named) arguments into a dictionary

```python
def print_arguments(*args, **kwargs):
    print(f"Positional arguments: {args}")
    print(f"Keyword arguments: {kwargs}")

print_arguments("hello", "world", a=1, b=2)
# Positional arguments: ('hello', 'world')
# Keyword arguments: {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```

## Positional arguments

Positional arguments are the ones you're already familiar with, where the order of the arguments matters. Like this:

```python
def sub(a, b):
    return a - b

# a=3, b=2
res = sub(3, 2)
# res = 1
```

## Keyword arguments

<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments">Keyword arguments</a> are passed in by name. Order does not matter. Like this:

```python
def sub(a, b):
    return a - b

res = sub(b=3, a=2)
# res = -1
res = sub(a=3, b=2)
# res = 1
```

## A note on ordering

Any positional arguments must come before keyword arguments. _This will not work_:

```python
sub(b=3, 2)
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

At Doc2Doc, we need better internal debugging tools. Complete the args_logger function. It takes a variable number of positional and keyword arguments and prints them to the console.

First, print each positional argument sequentially using numbers and periods as the prefixes. For example:

```python
args_logger("what's", "up", "doc") # prints:
# 1. what's
# 2. up
# 3. doc
```

Next, print each keyword argument alphabetically by key using asterisks (`*`) as the prefix with a colon (`:`) inbetween. For example:

```python
args_logger("hi", "there", age=17, date="July 4 1776") # prints:
# 1. hi
# 2. there
# * age: 17
# * date: July 4 1776
```

Use the sorted() function to get the order right.

### TIPS

// _Don't feel guilty using loops. The `.items()` method can iterate over a dictionary_

```python
for key, value in some_dict.items():
    # ...
```

_The `sorted()` function can sort a dictionary:_

```python
for key, value in sorted(some_dict.items()):
    # ...
```

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def args_logger(*args, **kwargs):
    i = 1
    for arg in args:
        print(f"{i}. {arg}")
        i += 1
    for key, value in sorted(kwargs.items()):
        print(f"* {key}: {value}")
```

# Decorators

The `*args` and `**kwargs` syntax is great for decorators that are intended to work on functions with different <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Signature/Function">signatures</a>.

The `log_call_count` function below doesn't care about the number or type of the decorated function's (`func_to_decorate`) arguments. It just wants to count how many times the function is called. However, it still needs to pass any arguments through to the wrapped function.

```python
def log_call_count(func_to_decorate):
    count = 0

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        print(f"Called {count} times")
        # The * and ** syntax unpacks the arguments
        # and passes them to the decorated function
        return func_to_decorate(*args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

Complete the `markdown_to_text_decorator` function. It can decorate a function with any number of string arguments, no matter if they're positional or keyword args. It will run the decorated function, but first strip out any Markdown heading symbols (see below for an explanation of Markdown headings).

It should `return` a `wrapper` function that takes `*args` and `**kwargs`. The wrapper should:

1. Map the `*args` to a new list where each string is converted to plain text using `convert_md_to_txt`.
2. Map the `**kwargs` to a new dictionary where each "value" is converted to plain text using `convert_md_to_txt`. The "key" should remain the same.
3. Return the result of calling the decorated function with the new arguments.

## TIPS

// _Take a look at the editor's `formatters.py` file tab to see what the formatter functions do. What arguments are they expecting? You can use `*` tuple unpacking and `**` dictionary unpacking operators to pass variables as the correct arguments._

// _The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map">`map()`</a> function_

// _Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list">`list()`</a> function to convert map results to a list_

// _Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict">`dict()`</a> function to convert map results to a dictionary_

// _The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.items">`.items()`</a> method can be used on a dictionary to get an iterable of key-value <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple">tuple</a> pairs_

// _The provided `convert_md_to_txt` function takes a string of <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">Markdown</a> text and returns a string of text with any "heading" symbols removed. For example:_

| Input                          | Output                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `# This is a heading`          | `This is a heading`            |
| `## This is also a heading`    | `This is also a heading`       |
| `This is not a heading`        | `This is not a heading`        |
| `* This is also not a heading` | `* This is also not a heading` |

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def markdown_to_text_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        converted_args = list(map(convert_md_to_txt, args))

        def kwarg_item_to_txt(item_tuple):
            key, value = item_tuple
            return (key, convert_md_to_txt(value))

        converted_kwargs = dict(map(kwarg_item_to_txt, kwargs.items()))
        return func(*converted_args, **converted_kwargs)

    return wrapper


# don't touch below this line


def convert_md_to_txt(doc):
    lines = doc.split("\n")
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        lines[i] = line.lstrip("# ")
    return "\n".join(lines)
```

# `lru_cache`

`lru_cache` from the `functools` module is an example of a decorator and an example of memoization.

`lru_cache` memoizes the inputs and outputs of the decorated function in a size-restricted dictionary. It speeds up repeated calls to a slow function with the same inputs. For instance, if the function reads from disc, makes network requests, or requires a lot of computation AND it is used repeatedly with the same inputs.

Here's an example from the Python documentation that perfectly illustrates how and why to use the `lru_cache` decorator:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache()
def factorial_r(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return x * factorial_r(x - 1)

factorial_r(10) # no previously cached result, makes 11 recursive calls
# 3628800
factorial_r(5)  # just looks up cached value result
# 120
factorial_r(12) # makes two new recursive calls, the other 11 are cached
# 479001600
```

Since the `factorial` function is recursive and the inputs are sequential numbers, it's called repeatedly with the same inputs. Without the cache, the function would be called 30 times. With `lru_cache`, the function is only called 13 times. While you don't often need to compute factorials, this example ties together how to use a decorator and memoization and recursion.

The creator of Doc2Doc is a huge fan of `palindromes` for some nerdy reason. Add a feature to check if a word is a palindrome.

1. Import the `lru_cache` function from the functools module. Use it to decorate the incomplete is_palindrome function.

2. Complete the `is_palindrome` function. It takes as input a word string and returns `True` if the word is a palindrome (such as "racecar"), or `False` otherwise. Try to use recursion. Check the outer characters first, then move inwards until you reach the base case or find the word is not a palindrome.
