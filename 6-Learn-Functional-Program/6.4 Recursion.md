# WHAT'S RECURSION?

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">Recursion</a> is a famously tricky concept to grasp, but it's honestly quite simple - don't let it intimidate you! A recursive function is just a function that calls itself!

```
Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.
```

## EXAMPLE OF RECURSION

If you thought loops were the only way to iterate over a list, you were wrong! Recursion is fundamental to functional programming because it's how we iterate over lists while avoiding stateful loops. Take a look at this function that sums the numbers in a list:

```python
def sum(nums):
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return 0

    return nums[0] + sum(nums[1:])

print(sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
# 15
```

Don't break your brain on the example above! Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. SOLVE A SMALL PROBLEM

Our goal is to sum all the numbers in a list, but we're not allowed to loop. So, we start by solving the smallest possible problem: summing the first number in the list with the rest of the list:

```python
return nums[0] + sum(nums[1:])
```

### 2. RECURSE

So, what actually happens when we call `sum(nums[1:])`? Well, we're just calling `sum` with a smaller list! In the first call, the `nums` input was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, but in the next call it's just `[2, 3, 4, 5]`. We just keep calling `sum` with smaller and smaller lists.

### 3. THE BASE CASE

So what happens when we get to the "end"? `sum(nums[1:])` is called, but `nums[1:]` is an empty list because we ran out of numbers. We need to write a base case to stop the madness.

```python
if len(nums) == 0:
    return 0
```

The "base case" of a recursive function is the part of the function that **_does not_** call itself.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

Doc2Doc can automatically generate various layouts for a page. There are a lot of possible layouts, so we need a factorial function to calculate the total number of possible layouts.

A factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a number. For example, `5!` (read: "five factorial") is `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`, which is `120`.

Complete `factorial_r` function. It should recursively calculate the factorial of a number.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def factorial_r(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 1
    return x * factorial_r(x - 1)
```

### TIPS

1. _What's a small problem you can solve first?_
2. _How can you go from the "first" value of `x` to the "next" value of `x`, all the way down to the "last" value of `x`?_
3. _What's the base case that should stop the recursion?_
4. _Since `0!` is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_product">empty product</a>, what should an input of `0` return?_

# RECURSION REVIEW

![alt text](img/xkcdRecursion.png)

The joke is that the characters within the Dungeons and Dragons game are also playing their own Dungeons and Dragons game. Maybe their character's game of DnD also has characters playing DnD, and so on, recursively forever.

## ANOTHER EXAMPLE

```python
def print_chars(word, i):
    if i == len(word):
        return
    print(word[i])
    print_chars(word, i + 1)

print_chars("Hello", 0)
# H
# e
# l
# l
# o

print_chars('elephant', 3)
# p
# h
# a
# n
# t
```

# ZIPMAP

This is another simple recursive function.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

Within Doc2Doc we need to map certain properties from one document to properties of another document. Complete the recursive `zipmap` function.

It takes two lists as input and returns a dictionary where the first list provides the _keys_ and the second list provides the _values_.

Example usage:

```python
zipped = zipmap(
    ["Avatar: The Last Airbender", "Avatar (in Papyrus font)", "The Last Airbender (Live Action)"],
    [9.9, 6.1, 2.1]
)

print(zipped)
# {
#   'Avatar: The Last Airbender': 9.9,
#   'Avatar (in Papyrus font)': 6.1,
#   'The Last Airbender (Live Action)': 2.1,
# }
```

### Here's the pseudocode:

1. If either the `keys` or `values` list is empty, return an empty dictionary (base case).
2. Recursively call `zipmap` on all but the first element from `keys` and `values`
3. Add the first element of `keys` to the resulting dictionary, and set its value to the first element in `values`
4. Return the updated dictionary

```bash
# Practicing Recursion - How to move the list without touching the first index.
>>> list
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> return_list(list)
'Done'
>>> def return_list(list):
...     if list == []:
...             return "Done"
...     print(list)
...     return return_list(list[1:])
...
>>> return_list(list)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[2, 3, 4, 5]
[3, 4, 5]
[4, 5]
[5]
'Done'
```

```python
def zipmap(keys, values):
    # If either the keys or values list is empty
    if keys == [] or values == []:
        # Return empty dictionary
        return {}

    #print(zipped, keys, values)
    zipped = zipmap(keys[1:], values[1:])
    zipped[keys[0]] = values[0]
    return zipped
```

## Recursion Quiz

```python
def countdown(n):
    print(n)
    if n == 0:
        return
    else:
        countdown(n - 1)

# Question 1: Which line contains the base case?
if n == 0:

# Which line contains the recursive call?
countdown(n - 1)

# What would happen if we swapped 'countdown(n - 1)' for countdown(n)
An infinite recursive loop
```

# NESTED SUM

Recursion is hard for all new developers. If you're struggling, that's okay! Take your time. That's why we're doing a few extra practice problems.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

In Doc2Doc, users can process files or _entire directories_. We need to know the _total_ size of those files and directories (measured in bytes).

Due to the nested nature of directories, we represent a root directory as a list of lists. Each list represents a directory, and each number represents the size of a file _in that directory_. For example, here's a directory that contains 2 files at the root level, then a nested directory with its own two files:

```python
root = [
    1,
    2,
    [3, 4]
]
print(sum_nested_list(root))
# 10
```

**Here's a more complex example:**

```bash
root
├── scripts.txt (5 bytes)
├── characters (dir)
│   ├── zuko.txt (6 bytes)
│   └── aang.txt (7 bytes)
└── seasons (dir)
    ├── season1 (dir)
    │   ├── the_avatar_returns.docx (8 bytes)
    │   └── the_southern_air_temple.docx (9 bytes)
    └── season2_notes.txt (10 bytes)
```

**Which would be represented as:**

```python
root = [
    5,
    [6, 7],
    [[8, 9], 10]
]
print(sum_nested_list(root))
# 45
```

Complete the `sum_nested_list` function. It takes a nested list of integers as input and should return the total size of all files in the list. It's a recursive function.

Here's some pseudocode to help you get started:

- Create an integer variable to keep track of the total size.
- For each item in the list (use a loop here):
  - If the item is an integer, add it to the total size.
  - If the item is a list, use a recursive call to `sum_nested_list` to get the size of that list. Add that size to the total size.
- Return the total size when you're done iterating.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def sum_nested_list(lst):
    # Initialize a directory size variable to count file sizes
    dir_size = 0

    # Search through the directories
    for file in lst:
        # If it is a single file, add the file size to `dir_size`
        if type(file) == int:
            dir_size += file
        # If it is another folder, go into that folder recursively
        if type(file) == list:
            # If it is a single file, add the file size to `dir_size`
            dir_size += sum_nested_list(file)

    # Return the total count of the file sizes and their directories
    return dir_size
```

### TIPS

// _You can use loops with recursion. While functional programming avoids loops, recursion can be used outside functional programming._

// _You can use the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance">isinstance</a> function to check if an item is an integer or a list:_

```python
isinstance(5, list)
# False
isinstance([5, 6], list)
# True
```

# RECURSION REVIEW

Recursion is so dang useful with tree-like structures because we don't always know how deep they're nested. Stop and think about how you would write nested loops to traverse a _tree of arbitrary depth..._ it's not easy, is it?

```python
for item in tree:
    for nested_item in item:
        for nested_nested_item in nested_item:
            for nested_nested_nested_item in nested_nested_item:
                # ... WHEN DOES IT END???
```

I most often use recursion on tree-like problems (file systems, nested dictionaries, etc). If I'm just iterating over a one-dimensional list then a loop (gasp...) is typically simpler, even if it's not as "pure" in the academic sense.

**Remember:** The rules of functional programming are just _philosophies_ to help you write better code, but it's not always the right tool for the job. The same goes for any programming paradigm.

# RECURSION ON A TREE

Recursion is often used in "tree-like" structures. For example:

- Nested dictionaries
- File systems
- HTML documents
- JSON objects

That's because trees can have unknown depth. It's hard to write a series of loops because you don't know how many levels deep the tree goes.

```python
for entry_i in directory:
    if entry_i.is_dir:
        for entry_j in entry_i:
            if entry_j.is_dir
                for entry_k in entry_j:
                    ...
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

You're responsible for a module in Doc2Doc that can scan a file system (represented in our code as nested dictionaries) and create a list of the filenames.

Complete the recursive `list_files` function. It accepts two arguments:

- `current_filetree` (dict): A dictionary representing the file system
- `current_path` (str): A string representing the current path (e.g. `root/dir1/dir2`)

It should return a list of file paths (strings).
**For example, this filetree:**

```python
{
    "Documents": {
        "Proposal.docx": None,
        "Receipts": {
            "January": {
                "receipt1.txt": None,
                "receipt2.txt": None
            },
            "February": {
                "receipt3.txt": None
            }
        }
    },
}
```

**Should result in the following list of file paths:**

```python
[
    "/Documents/Proposal.docx",
    "/Documents/Receipts/January/receipt1.txt",
    "/Documents/Receipts/January/receipt2.txt",
    "/Documents/Receipts/February/receipt3.txt"
]
```

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

### Working through the logic:

```python
# HAND TESTING AND NOT RECURSIVE YET...
test_dct = {'Doc' : {'prop.txt':None, 'prop2.txt':None}}
test_dct2= {'prop.txt':None, 'prop2.txt':None}


def testing_rec(test_dct, current_path=""):
    list_of_paths = []
    file_path = current_path
    dictionary = test_dct

    for file in dictionary:
        if dictionary[file] == None:
            list_of_paths.append(f"{file_path}/{file}")

        if type(dictionary[file]) == dict:
            # Recursion here
            print(f"There is another dictionary in here: {dictionary[file]}\nThe file: {file_path}/{file}\n")
            return dictionary[file], f"{file_path}/{file}"

    print(list_of_paths)


# {'Doc' : {'prop.txt':None, 'prop2.txt':None}}, ""
new, file = testing_rec(test_dct, current_path="")
testing_rec(new, file)
```

- I needed to figure out where my base case and recursion would be.
  - I need to recurse when I find that another entry is a type(x) = dictionary
  - If the value of the entry is `None`, then I need to add it to the list of file paths.
- Then I needed to figure out how to format filing convention when looping

```python
def list_files(current_filetree, current_path=""):
    # IN: current_filetree (dict)
    # IN: current_path (str)

    list_of_paths = []
    file_path = current_path
    dictionary = current_filetree

    for file in dictionary:
        if dictionary[file] == None:
            list_of_paths.append(f"{file_path}/{file}")

        #if type(dictionary[file]) == dict:
        else:
            list_of_paths.extend(list_files(dictionary[file], f"{file_path}/{file}"))
           #list_files(dictionary[file], f"{file_path}/{file}")

    return list_of_paths
```

# DANGER OF RECURSION

Recursion is great because it's simple and elegant, often being the most straightforward way to solve a problem. But there are some things to watch out for:

1. **Stack Overflow**: Each function call requires a bit of memory. So if you recurse too deeply, you can run out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation">:stack: memory</a>, which will crash your program. (This is what the famous website, Stack Overflow, is named after.)
2. If you don't have a solid base case, you can end up in an infinite loop (which will likely lead to a stack overflow).
3. Recursion (especially in a language like Python) is often slower than a `for` loop because each function call requires some memory. <a href="https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_tail-calls.html">Tail call optimization</a> can help with this, buy Python doesn't support it.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

**Count the Nested Levels**
In Doc2Doc, we might have documents nested inside other documents, forming a kind of tree. We want to find out how deeply nested a given document is.

Complete the `count_nested_levels` function.

It should recursively search for the `target_document_id` in the `nested_documents` dictionary and return the number of nested levels of that document.

If the target document doesn't exist, the function should return `-1`.

EXAMPLE:

The document with id `3` is nested 2 levels deep.
Document `2` is nested 1 level deep.

```python
{
    1: {
        3: {}
    },
    2: {}
}
```

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def count_nested_levels(nested_documents, target_document_id, level=1):
    # nested_documents -> dict
    # target_document_id -> int

    # We go into the first level of the dict
    for doc in nested_documents:
        # Check to see if the key is the doc we are looking for
        if doc == target_document_id:
            # If so, return the level
            return level
        # Otherwise, recursively look into the next level of the dictionary
        else:
            found = count_nested_levels(nested_documents[doc], target_document_id, level + 1)

        # If you did not find the doc in the other recursive functions, found will equal -1
        if found != -1:
            # Otherwise, return the level
            return found

    # Return -1 if the doc was not found
    return -1
```

At Doc2Doc we need to be able to reverse strings. Our bad-word detection algorithms need to work on those crazy teenagers who write unpleasantries backward to try to get around our filters!

However, being an ex-Haskell-loving university professor, our team lead has asked us to implement it using recursion instead of a loop.

Complete the `reverse_string` function.

- Take a string as a parameter
- Rreturn the reversed string by recursively reversing the substrings inside.
- Your function should recurse once for each character in the string.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def reverse_string(s):
    # Start the new string
    reverse_s = ""

    # If the inputted string is an empty string
    if s == "":
        # Return empty string
        return ""
    else:
        # Otherwise, continue adding the last character of the string to the new string, recursively.
        reverse_s = f"{s[-1]}{reverse_string(s[:-1])}"

    return reverse_s
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

In Doc2Doc, we have a search function to find the longest word. The only problem is, we don't know if the content being searched is a directory, a file, or just a word.

Complete the `find_longest_word` function without a loop. It accepts an input `content` that can be a list or a string and an input `longest` that is the current `longest` word and which defaults to an empty string. If content is a list, it can contain lists and/or strings.

1. If the `content` is empty, return `longest`.
2. If `content` is a string, split the string into words:

   - If the first word is longer than `longest`, replace `longest` with the first word.
   - The rest of the words are the new `content`.
   - Recursively call and return `find_longest_word` with `content` and `longest`.

3. Otherwise, `content` is a list:

   - Recursively call `find_longest_word` with the first element in `content` and `longest`, replacing `longest` with the result.
   - The rest of the items are the new `content`.
   - Recursively call and return `find_longest_word` with `content` and `longest`.
