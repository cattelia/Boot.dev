# What are Closures?

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)">closure</a> is a function that references variables from outside its own function body. The function definition and its environment are bundled together into a single entity.

Put simply, a closure is just a function that keeps track of some values from the place where it was defined, no matter where it is executed later on.

**For example:**

```python
def concatter():
	doc = ""
	def doc_builder(word):
		# "nonlocal" tells Python to use the 'doc'
		# variable from the enclosing scope
		nonlocal doc
		doc += word + " "
		return doc
	return doc_builder

# save the returned 'doc_builder' function
# to the new function 'harry_potter_aggregator'
harry_potter_aggregator = concatter()
harry_potter_aggregator("Mr.")
harry_potter_aggregator("and")
harry_potter_aggregator("Mrs.")
harry_potter_aggregator("Dursley")
harry_potter_aggregator("of")
harry_potter_aggregator("number")
harry_potter_aggregator("four,")
harry_potter_aggregator("Privet")

print(harry_potter_aggregator("Drive"))
# Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive
```

When `concatter()` is called, it creates a new "stateful" function that remembers the value of its internal `doc` variable. Each successive call to `harry_potter_aggregator` appends to that same `doc`.

### NONLOCAL

Python has a keyword called nonlocal that's required to access variables from an enclosing scope. Most programming languages don't require this keyword, but Python does.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

Doc2Doc keeps track of how many words are in a collection of documents.

Complete the `word_count_aggregator` function. It should return a function that calculates the number of words in its input (doc, a string). It should then add that number to an _enclosed_ `count` value and return the new `count`. In other words, it keeps a running total of the `count` variable within a closure.

### TIP

// _I used `.split()` to count the number of words in the doc string._

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def word_count_aggregator():
	# Start a counter
    count = 0

    def sum_values(document):
		# Access the counter variable using nonlocal keyword
        nonlocal count
		# Break the document into number of words
        words = document.split()
		# Add those number of words to counter
        count += len(words)
		# Return count
        return count

    return sum_values
```

# CLOSURE PRACTICE

Remember, a closure is a function that retains the state of its environment. That makes it useful for tracking data as it changes over time, but it can come at the cost of understandability.

When not to use the `nonlocal` keyword: when the variable is mutable (such as a list, dictionary or set), and you are modifying its contents rather than reassigning the variable. You only need the `nonlocal` keyword if you are reassigning a variable instead of modifying its contents (which you must do to change immutable values such as strings and integers).

Let's try a closure without the `nonlocal` keyword.

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment</strong></span>

It accepts a list of strings, `initial_docs`.

It should return a function that _closes **over** a copy_ of `initial_docs`. This function should accept a string, append that string to the closed-over list, and return the new list.

Do _not_ modify the original `initial_docs` list!

**For example:**

```python
new_collection = new_collection(["doc1", "doc2", "doc3"])
print(new_collection("doc4"))
# ['doc1', 'doc2', 'doc3', 'doc4']
print(new_collection("doc5"))
# ['doc1', 'doc2', 'doc3', 'doc4', 'doc5']
```

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def new_collection(initial_docs):

    new_docs = initial_docs.copy()

    def doc_change(input):
        new_docs.append(input)
        return new_docs

    return doc_change

```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: COPY / PASTE</strong></span>

Complete the `new_clipboard` function. It accepts a dictionary as input and returns two functions, `copy_to_clipboard` and `paste_from_clipboard`. It should not modify the original input dictionary.

- `copy_to_clipboard`: It takes a key and value string pair and adds them to the clipboard dictionary.
- `paste_from_clipboard`: It takes a key string and returns its value from the clipboard dictionary. If the key is missing from the clipboard, return an empty string.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

We know we need two functions:

1. copy_to_clipboard()
   - IN: key (str), value (str) and adds the key, value pair to the dictionary
   - OUT: None
2. paste_from_clipboard()
   - IN: key
   - OUT: value from Dictionary or an empty string

```python
def new_clipboard(initial_clipboard):
    # IN: Dictionary
    # OUT: Two functions, do not modify the original Dictionary input

    def copy_to_clipboard(key, value):
        pass

    def paste_from_clipboard(key):
        pass

    return copy_to_clipboard, paste_from_clipboard
```

Let's work on `copy_to_clipboard()`. We do not want to modify the original dictionary so we are going to make a copy of it.

```python
def new_clipboard(initial_clipboard):
    # IN: Dictionary
    # OUT: Two functions, do not modify the original Dictionary input

    copy_clippy = initial_clipboard.copy()

    def copy_to_clipboard(key, value):
        print("Before", copy_clippy)
        copy_clippy[key] = value
        print("After ", copy_clippy)

    def paste_from_clipboard(key):
        pass

    return copy_to_clipboard, paste_from_clipboard
```

Notice that I put print statements to see what happens to the copy of the dictionary, Mr. Clippy.

```python
# Test copy_to_clipboard function
intitial_clipboard = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
copy_to_clipboard, paste_from_clipboard = new_clipboard(intitial_clipboard)
copy_to_clipboard('d', 4)
```

The Output:

```python
Before {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
After  {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
```

So that works, let's move on to `paste_from_clipboard`. If the `key` is not with Mr. Clippy, we return an empty string.

```python
def new_clipboard(initial_clipboard):
    # IN: Dictionary
    # OUT: Two functions, do not modify the original Dictionary input

    copy_clippy = initial_clipboard.copy()

    def copy_to_clipboard(key, value):
        copy_clippy[key] = value

    def paste_from_clipboard(key):
        if key not in copy_clippy:
            print(f"'{key}' is not here")
            return ""

    return copy_to_clipboard, paste_from_clipboard

# main tests
intitial_clipboard = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
copy_to_clipboard, paste_from_clipboard = new_clipboard(intitial_clipboard)
copy_to_clipboard('d', 4)
paste_from_clipboard('e')
paste_from_clipboard('d')

# OUTPUT:
'e' is not here
```

Notice how Mr. Clippy could not find 'e' but it did see our earlier addition of 'd'. Great! Let's now get the value of the key.

```python
def new_clipboard(initial_clipboard):
    # IN: Dictionary
    # OUT: Two functions, do not modify the original Dictionary input

    copy_clippy = initial_clipboard.copy()

    def copy_to_clipboard(key, value):
        copy_clippy[key] = value

    def paste_from_clipboard(key):
        if key not in copy_clippy:
            return ""
		else:
            return copy_clippy[key]

    return copy_to_clipboard, paste_from_clipboard

# main tests
intitial_clipboard = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
copy_to_clipboard, paste_from_clipboard = new_clipboard(intitial_clipboard)
copy_to_clipboard('d', 4)
print(paste_from_clipboard('e'))
print(paste_from_clipboard('d'))

# OUTPUT:
""
4
```

# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>Assignment: USER WORDS</strong></span>

Complete the 'user_words' function. It accepts a tuple of `initial_words` as input and returns a function, `add_word`. Since tuples are immutable, you don't need to worry about modifying the `initial_words`. `add_word` should add a new `word` string to the words and return all words as a tuple.
