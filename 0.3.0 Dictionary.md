# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>DICTIONARIES</strong></span>

<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries">Dictionaries</a> in Python are used to store data values in `key` -> `value` pairs. Dictionaries are a great way to store groups of information.

```python
# use curly braces
# add key-value pairs
car = {
  "brand": "Tesla",
  "model": "3",
  "year": 2019
}
```

## ASSIGNMENT

Complete the get_character_record function. It takes a character's name, server, level, and rank as individual inputs, and returns a dictionary with the following keys:

- `name`
- `server`
- `level`
- `rank`
- `id`

Each key should map to its corresponding input, except the id key. The id key maps to the `name` and the `server` inputs concatenated with a `#` in the middle for uniqueness. We can't have two bloodwarrior123's on the same server!

For example, given:

- name = bloodwarrior123
- server = server1

Then the `id` field should be set to `bloodwarrior123#server1`. I recommend using an `f-string` to create the `id` field.

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

```python
def get_character_record(name, server, level, rank):
    character = {
        "name" : name,
        "server" : server,
        "level" : level,
        "rank": rank,
        "id" : f"{name}#{server}"
    }

    return character
```

## Output

```python
---------------------------------
Test Case #1

Expected: name: bloodwarrior123
Actual:   name: bloodwarrior123

Expected: server: server1
Actual:   server: server1

Expected: level: 5
